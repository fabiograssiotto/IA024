She had left her apartment in Dublin, Ireland so that she could go to the Wicklow Mountains for the day. She had asked a friend to accompany her but her friend declined. CCTV captured images of McCarrick in the Allied Irish Bank location in Sandymount, where she was seen withdrawing money from her bank account. She did some shopping at Quinnsworth supermarket before returning to her apartment at 3:00pm. She was seen on a bus at about 3:40pm in Ranelagh. During nighttime between the time of 9:00 and 11:00 pm, someone had claimed to have seen her at a pub called Johnnie Fox's in Glencullen talking to a young man who was wearing a wax jacket. The woman who was sighted by someone at the pub was believed to be McCarrick. McCarrick had gone to see an Irish music and dancing show that was a traditional event called the Hooley Show, but McCarrick did not realise there was a cover charge. McCarrick's male friend then paid for her, and continued to keep paying for her during her entire time there. Nobody saw either McCarrick or her male friend leave the pub, and the man's identity was never discovered. Since it was dark and wet outside, people question if she would have walked all the way to Enniskerry, which was 6 km away.\n",

    "text": "Since the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, the British government had wished to increase the size of Irish regiments, the part of the British Army charged on the Irish exchequer rather than the British. In 1767, the Chatham Ministry appointed George Townshend, 4th Viscount Townshend as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and instructed him to secure the support of the Irish parliament for an Augmentation Bill to effect this increase. The British considered several possible concessions to win over the Patriot Party, and at his speech from the throne, Townshend promised judicial tenure quamdiu se bene gesserint (on the model of the Act of Settlement 1701) and hinted at a Septennial Act. Lucas again introduced heads of a Septennial Bill on 20 October 1767; Barry Maxwell introduced heads of a judicial tenure bill the same day. In November, the appointment of James Hewitt, 1st Baron Lifford as Lord Chancellor of Ireland alienated the Undertakers who had hoped for the post. In addition, the British Privy Council added a wrecking clause to the judicial tenure bill, which caused the Irish parliament to reject the bill once returned to Dublin. The council also made three amendments to Lucas' bill: to the preamble, to extend the limit from seven to eight years (thus an Octennial Bill) and to bring forward the date of the next general election from 1774 to 1768. According to Francis Plowden, the Privy Council insisted on the modification to eight years as a wrecking amendment, expecting that the Irish parliament would reject the bill on principle once any amendment had been made to it, and was disappointed when its amended bill was passed. W. E. H. Lecky calls this \"without foundation\", stating the actual reasons for eight years were that the Irish Parliament only met every second year, and to reduce the chance of Irish and British general elections coinciding.\n",

    "text": "Born \"Santo Gennaro\" in Little Italy, (Manhattan's Lower East Side), Gennaro grew up on Staten Island, New York. At the age of 3 he showed interest in a toy drum and later at age 13 he played a friend's snare drum, which prompted him to buy his first drum set. At age 14 he joined his first band \"The Black and Blues\". Gennaro took private lessons and by 16 he was touring the New York/New Jersey/Pennsylvania circuit, playing high school dances, parties and minor musical events. At 18, Gennaro toured the Midwest playing night clubs and bars in a Cover band. In 1976 Gennaro moved to California and joined rock quartet Blackjack, featuring Michael Bolton, guitarist Bruce Kulick and bassist Jimmy Haslip. Blackjack recorded two albums and toured with Peter Frampton which eventually led Gennaro to record his first hit single with the New York-based singer Benny Mardones, \"Into the Night\" and LP Never Run, Never Hide. This was the beginning of Gennaro's association with the Pat Travers Band and afterwards his connection with singer/songwriter Cyndi Lauper, whose debut album She's So Unusual became a multi-platinum hit. Lauper hired Gennaro for the Fun Tour as well as other national and international tours and he appears on the concert video for the singer's single \"Money Changes Everything\". From here Gennaro went on to record and tour with Bo Diddley, Joan Jett and Johnny Winter.\n",

For over ten years in the 1980s and early 1990s he was keyboardist for the popular The Cosby Show and its spin-off, A Different World. Rob toured with R&B performer Freddie Jackson in the late 1980s before joining The Zen Tricksters. Rob spent eleven years touring and recording with The Tricksters, turning out two studio albums and playing live shows across the US and Canada. Their second album, A Love Surreal, brought the band to the attention of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh, who summoned Rob and Trickster guitarist Jeff Mattson to play a series of shows in San Francisco and then on to tour the country double billing with Bob Dylan. That band included drummer John Molo and Allman Brothers Band guitarists Derek Trucks and Warren Haynes. The following year Barraco became a member of the Phil Lesh Quintet, including Lesh, Barraco, Molo, Haynes, and guitarist Jimmy Herring. Known by fans as \"The Q\", the Quintet went on to tour the United States for three years and put out one studio album, There and Back Again. In 2002, Barraco joined with the original members of the Grateful Dead for two shows at the Alpine Valley Music Theater, and then toured with them as The Other Ones in 2002 and 2003. In 2004, he joined Chris Robinson's New Earth Mud. In 2005, Barraco toured with Dark Star Orchestra after the death of keyboardist Scott Larned and continues to play with them at the present time, although he also played sporadically with Phil Lesh and Friends in 2005 and continuously through 2006. Rob has also collaborated with Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter on seven songs recorded on his 2007 solo release, When We All Come Home.\n",

    "text": "By 1675, the Treaty of Westminster finalized the transfer and the area became part of the British colony of East Jersey, in the administrative district of Bergen Township. The county's seat was transferred to Hackensack in 1709, after Bergen County was expanded west. Small villages and farms supplied the burgeoning city of New York, across the river, notably with oysters from the vast beds in the Upper New York Bay, and fresh produce, sold at Weehawken Street, in Manhattan. During the American Revolutionary War the area was under British control which included garrisons at Bulls Ferry and the fort at Bergen Neck. Colonialist troops used the heights to observe enemy movements. The Battle of Paulus Hook, a surprise raid on a British fortification in 1779, was seen as a victory and morale booster for revolutionary forces. Many downtown Jersey City streets bear the name of military figures Mercer, Greene, Wayne, and Varick among them. Weehawken became notorious for duels, including the nation's most famous between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr in 1804. Border conflicts for control of the waterfront with New York (which claimed jurisdiction to the high water line and the granting of ferry concessions) restricted development though some urbanization took place in at Paulus Hook and Hoboken, which became a vacation spot for well-off New Yorkers. The Morris Canal, early steam railroads, and the development of the harbor stimulated further growth. In September 1840, Hudson County was created by separation from Bergen County and annexation of some Essex County lands, namely New Barbadoes Neck. During the 19th century, Hudson played an integral role in the Underground Railroad, with four routes converging in Jersey City.\n",

The first Winter Olympics, held in 1924, included speed skating, but the first official short track speed skating events were not held until the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. Before 1992, short track speed skating events were held at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport. At those games, events for both men and women were held in five disciplines: 500 metre, 1000 metre, 1500 metre, 3000 metre and the relay (3000 metres for women, 5000 metres for men). The Netherlands, United Kingdom and South Korea won two gold medals each, with Canada, Italy, Japan and China picking up a gold medal each. The results of those demonstration events are not considered official and are not included in this list. At the 1992 Winter Olympics, there were four medal events: men's 1000 metres, men's 5000 metre relay, women's 500 metres and women's 3000 metre relay. Men's 500 metres and women's 1000 metres was added in 1994. The men's and women's 1500 metres were added in 2002 and all eight events have been held at every Olympic Games since.\n",

    "text": "Timbaland began his producing career for R&B acts. In the early-1990s, he produced a few songs for R&B acts such as Jodeci and Sista. In 1996, he made his mainstream breakthrough by producing the majority of both Aaliyah's second album One in a Million and Ginuwine's debut album Ginuwine...the Bachelor. This included the major hit singles \"If Your Girl Only Knew\" by Aaliyah and \"Pony\" by Ginuwine. While Timbaland was initially producing for R&B artists, his trademark sound was very much rooted in hip-hop with its fast-paced nature and clear drum breaks. He was taking a hip-hop sound and applying it to R&B, and in this way his sound was instrumental in blurring the distinction between hip-hop and R&B production. In 1997, he fully produced Supa Dupa Fly, the debut album of Missy Elliott, who had been a childhood friend of Mosley. In this album Timbaland continued with his now trademark electronic production style, but since Missy frequently rapped the music was considered hip-hop. Also in 1997, he released his first album with his partner Magoo, Welcome to Our World, also a hip-hop album. In the late 1990s, his hip-hop production sound would become very influential and common as he produced for many high-profile hip-hop artists including Jay-Z, Nas, and The LOX. In 1999, he scored a major hit with Jay Z and rap group UGK with the hit \"Big Pimpin'\". He also fully produced Missy's second album in 1999, Da Real World. Still Timbaland in this period produced primarily for R&B artists. He continued to produce for Ginuwine and Aaliyah, as well as contributing significantly to albums by Xscape, Nicole, Playa, and Total. He remixed Usher's major hit \"You Make Me Wanna\". In the early 2000s Timbaland produced songs including Ludacris' \"Roll Out (My Business)\", Jay-Z's \"Hola' Hovito\", Petey Pablo's \"Raise Up\", and Beck's cover of David Bowie's \"Diamond Dogs\" during this period. He also contributed three songs, all eventually released as singles, to Aaliyah\u2019s self-titled third album, the exotic lead single \"We Need a Resolution\" (featuring himself rapping a verse), \"More than a Woman\", and the ballad \"I Care 4 U\". He also makes an appearance in Aaliyah's single \"Try Again\", which he also produced and co-wrote.\n",

It moved northeastward, and strengthened to attain winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) before passing within 10\u00a0miles (16\u00a0km) of the Outer Banks coast. Alex strengthened further and reached a peak of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) winds while off the coast of New England, one of only six hurricanes to reach Category 3 status north of 38\u00b0\u00a0N.

This led him to turn to the Church at an early age, first finding refuge with the Bishop of Freising and later being educated at the cathedral school of Hildesheim.

Before Henry II could arrive, however, Otto III died of fever, leaving no heir. After defeating several other claimants to the throne, Henry II was crowned as King of Germany (\"Rex Romanorum\") on July 9, 1002 and as King of Italy (\"Rex Italiae\") on 15 May 1004.

This was followed by their biggest-selling and longest-charting single \"Always\" (1994) and the album These Days (1995), which proved to be a bigger hit in Europe than in the United States, producing four Top Ten singles in the United Kingdom. Following a second hiatus, their 2000 album Crush, particularly the lead single, \"It's My Life\", successfully introduced the band to a younger audience. The band followed up with Bounce in 2002. The platinum albums Have a Nice Day (2005) and Lost Highway (2007) saw the band incorporate elements of country music into some of the songs, including the 2006 single \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\", which won the band a Grammy Award and became the first single by a rock band to reach No. 1 on the country charts. The Circle (2009) marked a return to the band's rock sound. The band also enjoyed great success touring, with both the 2005\u201306 Have a Nice Day Tour and 2007\u201308 Lost Highway Tour ranking among the Top 20 highest-grossing concert tours of the 2000s and the 2013 Because We Can Tour ranking among the highest-grossing of the 2010s.

A series of module adaptations for these novels (Shadowdale, Tantras, and Waterdeep) were released in the same year, along with the Hall of Heroes accessory, detailing many of the major characters appearing in Forgotten Realms novels published up through that time. In early 1990, the hardcover Forgotten Realms Adventures by Jeff Grubb and Ed Greenwood was released, which introduced the Realms setting to the second edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game and detailed how the Time of Troubles had changed the setting. The RPGA used the Forgotten Realms city of Ravens Bluff as the setting for their first living campaign. Official RPGA support for this product line included the Living City modules series. A number of sub-settings of the Forgotten Realms were briefly supported in the early 1990s. Three more modules were produced for the Kara-Tur setting. The Horde: Barbarian Campaign Setting, released in 1990, detailed The Hordelands, which also featured a series of three modules. The Maztica Campaign Set, released in 1991, detailed the continent of Maztica.\n",

    "text": "On May 18, 1964, O'Donnell provided testimony to Norman Redlich and Arlen Specter, assistant counsel for the Warren Commission. O'Donnell stated that it was his impression that the shots fired at Kennedy came from the right rear. In their memoir of Kennedy, Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye, both O'Donnell and David Powers reported hearing only three shots and did not offer any speculation as to their origin. According to a June 15, 1975 report in the Chicago Tribune, an unnamed \"Central Intelligence Agency liaison man\" told Congressman that O'Donnell and David Powers had initially told assassination investigators that the shots that struck Kennedy came from a location other than the Texas School Book Depository, but that the two men were convinced, reportedly by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover or his top aides, to alter their accounts to the Warren Commission to avoid the possibility of revealing the CIA's plots to kill Fidel Castro which might lead to an international incident. Responding in a telephone interview, O'Donnell said he testified truthfully and called the allegations \"an absolute, outright lie.\" In his 1987 autobiography Man of the House, former House Speaker Tip O'Neill wrote that he had dinner with O'Donnell and Powers in 1968, and that both men indicated that two shots were fired from behind the fence on the grassy knoll at Dealey Plaza. According to O'Neill, he pointed out to O'Donnell that he gave different information to the Warren Commission, and O'Donnell replied: \"I told the FBI what I had heard, but they said it couldn't have happened that way and that I must have been imagining things. So I testified the way they wanted me to. I just didn't want to stir up any more pain and trouble for the family.\"\n",

    "text": "The Heather Brothers were born in London and grew up in Zimbabwe, where they started the rock group The Chequers, touring Zimbabwe and South Africa. When they returned to England they were signed, along with Tammy Jones, by Mrs Wallich of Delyse Records to form a folk group, The Three People, and released a number of singles through EMI. After touring Germany they split up and the brothers formed the progressive rock band The Quiet World, recruiting arranger Philip Henderson and guitarist Steve Hackett (who went on to join Genesis). After releasing a number of singles for PYE and The Road album on PYE's progressive label, Dawn, they broke up the band and moved into contemporary music. Along with Henderson they formed a new orchestra using final year students from the Royal College and Royal Academy of Music, recording the orchestral album, Etheral Conception and the choral works 'Rebirth' and 'Seascape' for Starday King. They were then signed by Elvis Presley's publisher, Freddy Bienstock as contract songwriters to his publishing house Carlin Music. Soon after the brothers began writing musicals. A Slice of Saturday Night is their most successful musical and was followed by Lust, which played at the Haymarket Theatre. Other musicals include Big Sin City, The Comeback, Love Bites, Sin $ Salvation and Camp Horror, the thrillers Blood Money and Seriously Twisted and the comedy Oz And The Pom. 'Bobby Dallas After Party' they co-wrote with Mark Nassar and Brooke Lundy. The Heather Brothers have also written and directed two films, The Big Finish and Seriously Twisted. \n",

The oft-injured Tom Gugliotta was released and signed as a free agent with the Utah Jazz. The Suns found the injury bug, with reigning Rookie of the Year Amar'e Stoudemire missing nearly 30 games (and the Suns his 20 points and nine rebounds per game). Power forward Shawn Marion did not repeat as an All-Star, despite ending the season averaging 19 points and 9.3 rebounds per game and finishing second in the league in steals per game. Joe Johnson had a breakthrough year in his third season NBA season, leading the league in minutes played and providing the Suns nearly 17 points a game.\n",

    "text": "Portnoy was born in Washington, D.C., and studied comparative literature and creative writing at Vassar College and theater at the National Theater Institute at The Eugene O'Neill Theater Center. After moving to New York City, he formed several short-lived experimental theater groups and then began concentrating on solo performance. His early performance works, such as Gymnastics and Schizophrenia and 5teen3sy: Kicking Games of Lip, were antic and unpredictable, and characterized by dense language play, song and movement fragments and rapid transformations of character. In the mid 1990s, Portnoy regularly performed in venues such as Surf Reality and Luna Lounge's weekly show \"Eating It\", the epicenter of New York's alternative comedy scene. His wild and abstract theatrical performances, which occasionally interrupted and challenged other comedians on stage, prompted Time Out New York to describe him as \"the bad boy of comedy\", and the New York Post to dub him \"the next Andy Kaufman\". At the same time, Portnoy started working as a dancer for the New York choreographer Koosil-Ja Hwang, and as an actor. He also sang and performed his own operatic, electro-progressive-rock music as XAR, and with the band The Liquid Tapedeck.\n",

But, beyond the title and some music, there is no story connection to the earlier film. The Silence of the Lambs was adapted from the sequel novel to Red Dragon. The latter had been adapted for film as Manhunter by a different studio. Best Picture nominee The Lion in Winter features Peter O'Toole as King Henry II, a role he had played previously in the film Becket. But Winter is not a sequel to Becket. Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima was a companion piece to his film Flags of Our Fathers, released earlier the same year. These two films depict the same battle from the different viewpoints of Japanese and United States military forces; the two films were shot back-to-back. In addition, Black Panther is a continuation on the events that occurred in  and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",

The wise sage Zordon, who was responsible for capturing Rita (and also being enemies back on Zordon's homeworld, Eltar), later becomes aware of her release and orders his robotic assistant Alpha 5 to select five \"teenagers with attitude\" to defend the Earth from Rita's attacks. The five teens chosen are Jason Lee Scott, Kimberly Hart, Zack Taylor, Trini Kwan and Billy Cranston. Zordon gives them the ability to transform into a fighting force known as the Power Rangers; providing them with an arsenal of weapons at their disposal, as well as colossal assault machines called Zords which can combine into a giant humanoid machine known as the Megazord.\n\nThe series begins with five teenagers combating Rita and her seemingly endless array of monsters, while also dealing with typical teenage problems and clashing with local bullies Bulk and Skull. However, consecutive failures lead Rita to adopt a new method for conquering Earth and destroying the Power Rangers\u2014by attacking them with one of their own. Using her magic, Rita kidnaps and brainwashes a local teen whose fighting skills prove to equal that of Jason's in a martial-arts contest held in Angel Grove. The new teen, Tommy Oliver, passes Rita's tests, becoming the Green Ranger. Entrusted with Rita's Sword of Darkness, the source for the continuance of the evil spell he has fallen victim to, Tommy comes dangerously close to defeating the Power Rangers, especially when Rita causes a solar eclipse that drains the Megazord's power. However, the Green Ranger is ultimately defeated, and the Sword of Darkness is destroyed by Jason. Now free from Rita's spell, Tommy chooses to use his Green Ranger powers to assist the other Rangers in defeating the evil that gave them to him in the first place. His Zord, the Dragonzord, is reconfigured to enable it to help form more powerful Zord combinations alongside the other Dinozords.\n\nAs time goes on, Rita focuses on eliminating Tommy in order to regain the powers that she believes belong to her. Using a special wax that was touched by Tommy when he was evil, Rita uses a magic Green Candle to slowly remove his powers, returning them to her. In the end, Tommy loses his powers, but he prevents Rita from reclaiming them by transferring them to Jason who, feeling guilt for failing to protect Tommy's powers, accepts them. However, Tommy later returns to the team when the other Rangers' Power Coins are handed over to Rita in exchange for their kidnapped parents. With Zordon's help, Tommy regains his powers and successfully retrieves the other Rangers' Power Coins. However, Tommy's regained powers are only temporary and must be frequently re-charged by Zordon, who warns that the Green Ranger's powers will ultimately fail. Despite this, Tommy remains determined to continue assisting the other Rangers as long as possible.\n\nSeason 2 (1994\u20131995).Lord Zedd, Rita's superior, arrives at Rita's Moon Palace, where he takes her place and throws her into a space dumpster again. He then begins his own campaign to conquer Earth. In order for the Power Rangers to compete with Zedd's monsters, which are superior to the ones Finster made for Rita, Zordon and Alpha upgrade the Dinozords into the more powerful Thunderzords (which combine into the Thunder Megazord). However, Tommy is forced to retain use of the Dragonzord, due to his powers being too weak to support a new Zord.\n\nAfter several defeats, Zedd's attack on the Rangers progressively becomes more violent. He focuses his attention on eliminating Tommy, whom he sees as Rita's biggest mistake in giving him the Dragon Coin. The Green Ranger's powers were rapidly deteriorating, but Zedd's efforts had enhanced the process. He eventually does so with a special Green Crystal, using it to take away the Green Ranger's powers. The crystal also powers up Zedd's Dark Rangers, but when Tommy smashes it, the Dark Rangers powers are transferred back to the regular Rangers. Nevertheless, Zedd finally succeeds in taking the Green Ranger's powers (which Rita later uses to empower Tommy's clone to battle against the Rangers before reclaiming it once more). Following the loss of the Green Ranger's powers, Zordon and Alpha create, in secret, a new White Ranger to aid the other Rangers in battle. The White Ranger is revealed to be Tommy, who in addition receives a new Zord, the Tigerzord, and also becomes the new leader of the Power Rangers (replacing Jason).\n\nDuring the Team Ninja Trials in Angel Grove, the Rangers become friends with three teenagers from Stone Canyon: Rocky DeSantos, Adam Park and Aisha Campbell. During an ensuing battle with Zedd and a magical serpent, Rocky, Adam and Aisha discover the Rangers' identities and, having been entrusted with their secret by Zordon himself, the three newcomers become allies of the Rangers.\n\nLater on, Jason, Zack and Trini are selected to represent Angel Grove at the World Peace Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Rangers are faced with the task of finding replacements. In order to transfer the powers of the Red, Black and Yellow Rangers, they must find the Sword of Light, which is located on the Deserted Planet. Zedd pursues them across the galaxy in Serpentera, his massive personal Zord, and destroys most of the Deserted Planet. Serpentera runs out of power before being able to finish the Rangers, and they return to Earth safely with the Sword of Light. Zordon then chooses Rocky, Adam and Aisha to replace Jason, Zack and Trini as the Red, Black and Yellow Rangers, respectively.\n\nSometime before the power transfer, Rita had returned to Earth when Tommy made his debut as the White Ranger, and fell into the hands of Bulk and Skull, but the Rangers sent her back into space. She later returns to the Moon while the Rangers are in Australia, and with the help of Finster, she gets a special \"makeover\" to gain a younger and \"prettier\" face. She then uses a love potion on Zedd, who is in a deep sleep during his centennial re-evilizer, and he falls in love with her when he wakes up. They get married and thus join forces to make an even more terrible threat for the Rangers, but not even this can prepare them for what is to come.\n\nSeason 3 (1995\u20131996).Rito Revolto, Rita's skeletal brother, comes to Earth and, with the help of a group of monsters, destroys the Rangers' Thunderzords and the Tigerzord. As a result, the Dinozords are also destroyed and the Power Coins are damaged beyond repair. Undaunted, the Power Rangers seek the aid of Ninjor, alleged creator of the Power Coins, who gives them new Ninja Coins, providing them with the even more powerful Ninjazords (which combine into the Ninja Megazord) and the Falconzord.\n\nAn Australian girl named Kat Hillard moves to Angel Grove. She befriends Kimberly, and displays an intense affection for Tommy. Later it is found that Rita had captured Kat and put her under a powerful spell, giving her the ability to transform into a normal cat as well as a cat-like monster. Under this spell, she steals Kimberly's Ninja Coin, vastly weakening and nearly killing the Pink Ranger, whose life force, like that of the other Ninja Rangers, is connected to her Ninja Coin. It is during this time that the Rangers acquire their most powerful Zords ever: the Shogunzords (which combine into the Shogun Megazord). Eventually, Kat overcomes Rita's evil spell and returns Kimberly's Ninja Coin to her. A short time thereafter, Kimberly gets a chance to pursue her personal athletic dreams. With Zordon's blessing, she leaves to train for the Pan Global Games, choosing Kat to replace her as the Pink Ranger. Though her initial fear and hesitation keeps her from contributing fully to the fight against evil, Kat eventually becomes both comfortable and capable of fulfilling her duty as a Ranger.\n\nAfter several more battles, Zedd and Rita are joined by Rita's father, Master Vile. Following his failed attempts to defeat the Rangers, he reverses time, turning the Rangers into powerless children. These events culminate in the mini-series Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers and lead to the next incarnation of the franchise, entitled Power Rangers Zeo.\n\n",

    "text": "Bosch auditioned for the Power Rangers show in Dallas after being informed of the audition by his martial arts instructor. In 1994, he landed the role of Adam Park, the new Black Power Ranger, replacing Walter Emanuel Jones in the second season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Bosch said that when he got the part, he changed his middle name to Yong, which was part of his mother's given name, at the request of Saban who thought his credited name needed to be more Asian. For the feature film , he did all of his stunts after his stuntman had broken his leg. He also noted that among all the different animal characters the Rangers got to be associated, his was associated to a frog. In Power Rangers Zeo, Bosch's character became a Green Ranger. His final regular stint in the franchise was in Power Rangers Turbo, where his character passes his Green Turbo Ranger powers to a new member. He played Park in the second feature film . In looking back at his acting for the show, Bosch said that \"Power Rangers was a lot of fun but it was a kid's show and very cheesy because of it, which made getting work after that really hard. Plus, I didn't know squat about acting then.\" His best friends on the set included Jason David Frank (who played Tommy Oliver), Jason Narvy (who played Skull) and Nakia Burrise (who played Tanya Sloan). At the request of Power Rangers director Koichi Sakamoto, he had a guest appearance in the Power Rangers Operation Overdrive episode \"Once A Ranger\" in 2007 for the franchise's 15th anniversary, where he mentioned he got to go to New Zealand. He and Narvy also starred in the film Wicked Game, also known as Extreme Heist, which was directed by Sakamoto and features several other Power Rangers alumni.\n",

    "text": "Richard Bickerton was tutored at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, by Sir John Colborne, in classics, English, French, arithmetic, writing, and theology, where he received a Latin Prize in 1828. He and all three of his siblings accompanied their father and mother to Valletta, Malta, in 1828, where they were homeschooled in the works of Enlightenment philosophy, including those of William Robertson, astrology, history, and the classics, in addition to French and Modern Greek, in both of which he developed fluency. After an initial tour of the Aegean, his father returned to Valletta to refit his ship, HMS Blonde, before sailing again for the Aegean on 30 January 1829: on this second journey, he took his two sons. The two sons were tutored on the boat, explored Greece on excursions into the mainland, and were introduced to prominent members of society. Richard Bickerton returned to England to attend Winchester College. He subsequently attended Christ Church, Oxford, at which he graduated BA, in 1838, and MA, in 1843. He later, in 1865, received an honorary DCL from Oxford. By the time at which he had begun his diplomatic career, he possessed, like his father, a mastery of several languages.\n",

    "text": "After a failed attempt by France to colonize Texas in the late 17th century, Spain developed a plan to settle the region. On its southern edge, along the Medina and Nueces Rivers, Spanish Texas was bordered by the province of Coahuila. On the east, Texas bordered Louisiana. Following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, the United States also claimed the land west of the Sabine River, all the way to the Rio Grande. From 1812 to 1813 anti-Spanish republicans and U.S. filibusters rebelled against the Spanish Empire in what is known today as the Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition during the Mexican War of Independence. They won battles in the beginning and captured many Texas cities from the Spanish that led to a declaration of independence of the state of Texas as part of the Mexican Republic on April 17, 1813. The new Texas government and army met their doom in the Battle of Medina in August 1813, 20 miles south of San Antonio, where 1,300 of the 1,400 rebel army were killed in battle or executed shortly afterwards by royalist soldiers. It was the deadliest single battle in Texas history. 300 republican government officials in San Antonio were captured and executed by the Spanish royalists shortly after the battle. What is significant is a Spanish royalist lieutenant named Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna fought in this battle and followed his superiors' orders to take no prisoners. Another interesting note is two founding fathers of the Republic of Texas and future signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence in 1836, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Navarro and Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz, took part in the Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition. Although the United States officially renounced that claim as part of the Transcontinental Treaty with Spain in 1819, many Americans continued to believe that Texas should belong to their nation, and over the next decade the United States made several offers to purchase the region.\n",

Again feuding with Mapleson, they sang together in concert in Dover, with The Hall\u00e9 in Manchester and at The Crystal Palace in London, before departing to appear in Italy where, among other roles, he played the title role in Faust and she played Marguerita. Their son, Jack A. Bentham, was born in Florence in 1873. After this, the couple separated. On returning to London alone Bentham again appeared in Monday Pops and other London concerts, including at the Royal Albert Hall. In 1874 he returned to Mapleson at Her Majesty\u2019s Theatre in the title role of Faust, to familiar reviews: \"To be frank, there is yet something to acquire and something to discard ere Mr Bentham will take that position which his excellent voice should enable him to do ultimately.\" He next played Tamino in The Magic Flute. He returned to the Gloucester festival and was a soloist at the Liverpool Festival and the Leeds Music Festival, conducted by Sir Michael Costa, and also sang in Edinburgh that year. In early 1875 he sang in Elijah at the Royal Albert Hall, while in 1876 he toured with the Imperial Italian Opera Company, with whom he sang Alfredo in La Traviata, opposite Emma Howson. In early 1877, he sang in a starry concert party for Mapleson, earning warm reviews.\n",

Appointed from Virginia to the United States Naval Academy in 1908, Buckmaster graduated with the Class of 1912.

Following command of Farragut, Commander Buckmaster applied for flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola.

Cantillo was only 17 years old, but quickly established himself as among the most talented players in the league when he won MVP honors as a rookie. The Comets also won the league championship that season. Cantillo earned MVP honors in 1974, and in 1975 was a first team All Star for the fourth consecutive year. In February 1975 the Comets loaned him to the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League for the upcoming NASL indoor tournament. Castillo went on to win the Regional MVP award, before getting injured early in the championship final. He scored five goals in four games for the 1975 indoor Rowdies. At the end of the 1975 ASL season, the Comets traded Cantillo to New York Inter-Giuliana SC, of the semi-pro German-American Soccer League, which played in the winter months. They also loaned him to Tampa Bay for the 1976 NASL season. He played a single season, twenty-one games total, with the Rowdies before returning to the ASL, this time signing with the New Jersey Americans. Cantillo was part of the ASL's most exciting team as the Americans played a free flowing attacking game which took them to the 1977 championship. Cantillo was again the league MVP, his third in five years in the ASL, and a first team All Star. Cantillo jumped leagues again at the end of the 1977 season. He joined the New England Tea Men of the NASL. He would remain with this team in its various incarnations until 1985, except for 1983 when he played for Team America. The Tea Men spent the 1978-1980 seasons in New England before moving to Jacksonville, Florida at the end of the 1980 season. Cantillo moved with the team and played the 1981 and 1982 seasons with Jacksonville. In the fall of 1982, he signed with the New York Arrows of Major Indoor Soccer League. He spent one season with the Arrows. In 1983, he signed with Team America. That year, the U.S. Soccer Federation attempted to create a more successful U.S. national team by entering the team into the NASL as a franchise. However, the team stumbled to a 10-20 record and the bottom of the league standings and USSF pulled the national team from the NASL at the end of the season. In 1984, Cantillo returned to the Tea Men who by then played in the United Soccer League.\n",

Hering realised that she preferred environmental sciences and moved to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for her graduate studies. She completed her PhD thesis \"The Kinetics and Thermodynamics of Copper Complexation in Aquatic Systems\" in 1988. Her supervisor, Fran\u00e7ois Morel, described her research as \"elegant work on the surprisingly slow kinetics of some reactions between trace metals and organic complexing agents in natural water\". She described the preparation of Aquil, an artificial algal culture, and the coordination of transition metals in seawater. At MIT, Hering met Werner Stumm, who offered her a postdoctoral position at EAWAG.\n",

Returning to Russia in 1917, he was a leading figure in the Proletkult movement, and head of ROSTA, forerunner of the TASS news agency. He had articles published in Vestnik Teatra, the Journal of the Theatre Department of Narkompros based in Moscow. In 1921, when Proletkult was taken under party control, on Lenin's instructions, and its founder, Alexander Bogdanov was ousted, Kerzhentsev was appointed Ambassador in Sweden. He returned in 1923, and criticised Bogdanov in Pravda where he focused on The Organizational Principles of a Uniform Economic Plan a text submitted to the First Conference on Scientific Organization of Labour (January 1921). In 1923-25, he ran an institute that studied labour organisation. He opposed piece work and other incentives which he believed would create a 'working class aristocracy.

In 1684, Perth Amboy became the capital of East Jersey and remained the capital until the union of East and West Jersey in 1702, and became an alternate colonial capital with Burlington until 1776. A few of the buildings from this early period can still be seen today. Most notably, the Proprietary House, the home of William Franklin, the last Royal Governor of New Jersey and estranged son of Benjamin Franklin, still stands in the waterfront area of the city. St. Peter's Church was founded in 1718 by the first Episcopal congregation in the state. Its current building, dating from 1875, is surrounded by a graveyard of early inhabitants and displays a collection of stained-glass windows with religious scenes as well as early depictions of New Jersey receiving her charter and a meeting between William Franklin and his father, Ben. Perth Amboy City Hall, first built as a courthouse in 1714, survived major fires in 1731 and 1764 and is the oldest city hall in continuous use in the United States. The Kearny Cottage, moved from its original location, is a remaining example of 18th-century vernacular architecture.\n",

This brigade was mustered out in March 1863 before Kane could lead it in combat. Kane was assigned a new brigade (now in the 2nd Division of the XII Corps) and saw action at Chancellorsville. After his horse stumbled in the Rapidan River and dumped him into the water on April 28, 1863, Kane developed a case of pneumonia. He was sent to a Baltimore, Maryland, hospital, where he remained through June. Upon hearing of General Robert E. Lee's second invasion of the North (Lee's Gettysburg Campaign), Kane volunteered to convey intelligence to the commander of the Army of the Potomac, George Gordon Meade, and rose from his sickbed to join his men. On a difficult ride by railroad and buggy, he avoided capture by Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry by disguising himself as a civilian. He arrived at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on the morning of July 2, 1863.\n",

After a lack of help and extensive delays, von M\u00fccke marched his force to Sana'a, arriving on 6 February 1915. After another round of delays disguised as hospitality, the Germans returned to Hodeida, hired two sambuks and sailed north along the coast on 14 March. Three days later, one sambuk grounded on a coral reef, then sank with no lost crew. On reaching Al Qunfudhah, von M\u00fccke hired a larger vessel, then sailed to Al Lith, where one of the Germans died from typhus. The Germans headed overland to Jeddah with a party of Turkish and Arab guards, and were forced to fight running battles against Bedouin raiders from 30 March. Another two Germans were killed, and a third wounded before a relief force arrived to escort them to Jeddah. Another chartered sambuk took the party to Al Wajh, arriving on 29 April. They were escorted to the Hejaz Railway, then travelled to Constantinople, reporting to the German admiral stationed there on 23 May.\n",

The most notable success was cutting all railway lines leading to and from Minsk in May 1942 and a similar action in Brze\u015b\u0107 in August of the same year. Between December 1942 and February of the following year a large part of the 4th sector was arrested by the Gestapo.

    "text": "Alex Forbes, the manager of the professional team brought Mike into the first team squad. His full professional debut was made in 1972 at the age of 16 against Durban City. In 1973 Mike was invited to go on trial with Arsenal in England. He spent 6 months on trial but was not signed. He returned to Rangers. In 1974 Eddie Firmani, the new coach of the Tampa Bay Rowdies in Tampa USA, was scouting for players in South Africa. Rangers was playing Arcadia Shepherds who featured Steve Wegerle. After Mike was substituted his father confronted Alex Forbes on the field. An act Eddie Firmani realised gave him opportunity to get Mike. In 1975 at the age of 18 Mike arrived in Tampa, Florida USA. He remained under contract every season for the Rowdies until the NASL collapsed in 1984. He was forced to miss the entire 1976 outdoor and 1976 indoor seasons while he fulfilled his South African military obligation. His years with the team included one championship, in 1975, and two runners-up, in 1978 and 1979. In NASL indoor he won one championship in 1979-80 and one runner-up in 1981-82. Connell was also part of the 1983 Indoor Grand Prix winning side, though he did not play in the final due to injury. He was a 1979 and 1980 First Team All Star and a 1982 Honourable Mention All Star. He ranks third in career NASL regular season games played with 252. Connell holds the NASL all-time record for consecutive regular season starts with 179. The streak came to an unceremonious end on the last day of the 1984 season, with Connell's somewhat controversial benching by then coach and former teammate, Rodney Marsh, in what was to be the Rowdies final NASL game. In 1985, he spent some time with both the recently-independent Tulsa Roughnecks, and also the Tulsa Tornados of the United Soccer League After the USL folded midseason, he returned to the Rowdies, now playing as an independent club for one match. He spent one season, 1988, in the ASL with the Rowdies' arch-rival, Fort Lauderdale Strikers, before fully retiring as a player.\n",

He seized control of the capital Luoyang in 189 when it entered a state of turmoil following the death of Emperor Ling of Han and a massacre of the eunuch faction by the court officials led by General-in-Chief He Jin. Dong Zhuo subsequently deposed Liu Bian (Emperor Shao) and replaced him with the puppet Emperor Xian of Han. Dong Zhuo's rule was brief and characterized by cruelty and tyranny. In the following year, a coalition of regional officials and warlords launched a campaign against him. Failing to stop the coalition forces, Dong Zhuo sacked Luoyang and relocated further west to Chang'an. He was assassinated soon after in 192 by his subordinate L\u00fc Bu in a plot orchestrated by Interior Minister Wang Yun.\n",

Reinforcements were held back from Canada and reliance was instead made on local militias and native allies to bolster the British Army in Canada. However, after the defeat and exile of Napoleon Bonaparte in April 1814, Britain was able to use its now available troops and ships to prosecute its war with the United States. In addition to reinforcements sent to Canada, the Earl of Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, dispatched an army brigade and additional naval vessels to Bermuda, from where a blockade of the US coast and even the occupation of some coastal islands had been overseen throughout the war. It was decided to use these forces in raids along the Atlantic seaboard to draw American forces away from Canada. The commanders were under strict orders, however, not to carry out operations far inland, or to attempt to hold territory. Early in 1814, Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's North America and West Indies Station, controlling naval forces based at the new Bermuda dockyard and the Halifax Naval Yard which were used to blockade US Atlantic ports throughout the war. He planned to carry the war into the United States by attacks in Virginia and against New Orleans.\n",

    "text": "He attended Culford School near Bury St Edmunds where he captained the rugby first XV and edited the school magazine. Upon leaving school he became a junior reporter in Cambridge and then a freelance Fleet Street journalist reporting on tennis and rugby union. He began his television career at Westward TV in the 1960s, and then as an ATV sports reporter for their ATV Today programme in the early 1970s. The continuing illness of his boss, Controller of Sports Billy Wright, the former England football captain meant that he and a small team - including Trevor East - had to carry out Wright's functions whilst covering up the extent of his ill-health. He himself later became Controller of Sports (West Midlands) for ATV and, later, Central Television, Newbon reported on football and hosted boxing and darts programmes for the ITV network, whilst hosting sports coverage on ATV and Central, while also presenting sports reports on the regional news programmes and performing his executive role. Newbon conducted post-match interviews, including a memorable exchange with Brian Clough after Nottingham Forest had lost 4-0 to Everton, when Newbon's question about Forest's lack of commitment was replied to with \"Because they're just like you and me, Gary - a bunch of pansies\", after which Clough kissed Newbon on the cheek and walked off. Newbon sparked a controversy in 1983 when he appeared to show two fingers to the QPR manager.\n",

He spent the next few seasons with the White Sox, becoming their regular second baseman. In 1984, Law hit 17 home runs, the most homers he'd ever hit in one season in the majors. Law would be on the move again, this time traded to the Montreal Expos in exchange for pitcher Bob James. In 1987, The expos did not renews his contract, which allowed him to become a free agent. He signed with the Chicago Cubs later that winter. Law's best season in the Major Leagues was in when he hit .293, with 163 hits, and 78 RBIs. He was selected to the 1988 All-Star Game as one of a then-record six Cubs players on the team (Andre Dawson, Greg Maddux, Ryne Sandberg, Rafael Palmeiro, and Shawon Dunston were the other five.)\n",

    "text": "Tajiri originally wanted to become a kickboxer and began training in the sport. However, after watching countless wrestling matches from Mexico, he entered the Animal Hamaguchi Wrestling gym and won its test match tournament. Tajiri debuted professionally in 1994 for International Wrestling Association of Japan (IWA Japan) with a loss to Takashi Okano. In 1996, Tajiri left CMLL to join the hardcore wrestling promotion Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW) in Tokyo, Japan. He debuted for BJW under the name Aquarius. On July 19, 1996, he defeated Dr. Wagner Jr. to win the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship but lost it to him on July 27. The championship changes were not approved by CMLL but done by Dr. Wagner Jr. and Aquarius as part of the tour. Since CMLL did not approve the championship reign they do not officially recognize Aquarius' championship reign, listing Dr. Wagner as one continuous reign during the time he toured Japan. On July 23, 1997, Tajiri teamed up with Ryuji Yamakawa to win the vacant BJW Tag Team Championship. They lost it to Gedo and Jado on December 22. The team would regain the titles eleven days later, before losing it to Shadow Winger and Shadow WX. Tajiri then beat Gedo to become the first BJW Junior Heavyweight Champion. He would later be stripped of the title when he left the company. That same year, Tajiri competed for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), participating in the promotion's Best of the Super Juniors IV tournament as a guest from BJW. He won three matches but also lost three and did not advance from the first-round.\n",

The huge spruce and hemlock became accessible in 1884 when the West Virginia Central and Pittsburgh Railroad, a predecessor of the Western Maryland Railway, first arrived at nearby Davis, from a junction with the B&O Railroad at Piedmont. In 1899, the Parsons Pulp and Lumber Company (PPLC) established a sawmill at Dobbin on the North Branch Potomac River in Grant County. In 1902, the PPLC installed a new band saw mill on the main stem of Red Creek. The lumber boom town of Laneville soon sprang up around it with a population that peaked at over 300 people.Shay locomotives climbed the temporary railroads into the mountains and backcountry logging camps sprang up throughout the Sods, clearing away the virgin forest to feed the hungry mills. Teams of draft horses dragged all the commercial timber to the nearest tracks. When the timber was exhausted in the sector around one camp, the rails were taken up and reused elsewhere. It was into the mill at Laneville that most of the timber of the southern two thirds of the Sods disappeared.\n",

However, the Football Association had previously agreed to inclusion criteria with the organizers which mandated that only League Cup winners from Division One would be able to take part.

The team then went on to win the 1970 Anglo-Italian Cup competition in a tournament beset by hooliganism. The final against S.S.C.

He was also a noted archaeologist and historian, and an important figure in the history of architectural preservation. He is best known for his novella Carmen, which became the basis of Bizet's opera Carmen. He learned Russian and translated the work of several important Russian writers, including Pushkin and Gogol, into French. From 1830 until 1860 he was the inspector of French historical monuments, and was responsible for the protection of many historic sites, including the medieval citadel of Carcassonne and the restoration of the fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. Along with the writer George Sand, he discovered the series of tapestries called The Lady and the Unicorn, and arranged for their preservation. He was instrumental in the creation of Mus\u00e9e national du Moyen \u00c2ge in Paris, where the tapestries now are displayed. The official database of French monuments, the Base M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, bears his name.\n",

He accepted the invitation and announced that he would at the same time hold a council. This irritated King Henry I of France, since it was generally held that no pope could hold a council in Kingdom of France without first consulting the king, which Leo IX had neglected to do. Consequently, in order to frustrate Leo IX, Henry I ordered all of his vassals to attend a feudal levy at the very time that the council was to be held. This placed the bishops and abbots in France in a very difficult position: they were ordered by Leo IX to attend the council; they were ordered by Henry I to attend the levy. Henry I hoped that his action would prevent the holding of the council, but Leo IX went on with his preparations without paying any attention to Henry I's act. The council was held at the appointed time, and in addition to churchmen from other lands about one-third of the bishops and abbots from the king's territory attended. Those who were absent with Henry I were excommunicated by Leo IX. Then Leo IX took up cases of simony and other ecclesiastical crimes which were reported. Several of those who were present at the council and held high offices in the church were accused of very serious offenses. Leo IX did not push any of them to an extreme, even when the guilt seemed definitely known, but adjourned all of the cases to his own court at Rome. Leo IX acted in the same way with regard to the accusations made against the great nobles. By this policy Leo IX hoped to have the authority of the papacy fully recognized. He was able to accomplish so much because of the weakness of the French monarchy. Leo IX was aided by Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, in other attempts at reform, with whom he worked apparently in complete concord. Leo IX died in 1054 without having an opportunity to see the full effect of his act which had done so much to strengthen the power of the papacy.\n",

The southern half of New Mexico Territory and the newly created Arizona Territory joined the Confederacy in 1861 so troops in California were raised to occupy the region. After Lieutenant George Bascom's 1860 confrontation with Chief Cochise sometimes called the Bascom Affair, the Apache began attacking Union and Confederate troops across Arizona. By early 1865 the Chiricahua War was still being waged. According to reports at the time of attack, only nine American cavalrymen manned the fort, which did not have walls and was just a collection of military buildings including a vedette station. Corporal Michael Buckley from Company L of the 1st California Cavalry commanded and with the eight others he occupied the vedette station that was very similar to a small house.\n",

In Wittenberg he became a follower of Martin Luther, and stayed in touch with the Protestant Reformation when he relocated to Neisse (Nysa) in 1513 as the secretary of Johannes V. Thurzo, bishop of Breslau. In 1518 He\u00df moved to Bologna to study theology, completing his studies there in 1519. On the way back to Silesia he stopped in Wittenberg and became a friend of Philipp Melanchthon. In 1520 he was ordained to the priesthood and in 1523 He\u00df was pressed by the city council of Breslau (probably at the instigation of Laurentius Corvinus) to become pastor of St. Maria Magdalena church. In the coming years he slowly introduced Protestant teachings in Breslau, presenting his ideas in a disputation at St Dorothy's monastery at Breslau in 1524. His careful approach even normalized the relationship to Catholic bishop Jakob von Salza. Theologically he, Ambrosius Moibanus, pastor of St. Elisabeth church, and the city council of Breslau sided with Wittenberg and opposed Caspar Schwenckfeld and his followers in Liegnitz (Legnica). In 1541 he took part in the Conference of Regensburg. In 1547 He\u00df died in Breslau.\n",

A same rating was given by Ludovic Hunter-Tilney from Financial Times who complimented Bennett's vocals but felt Gaga's solo performances \"stole the show\". Jim Farber from New York Daily News reviewed the first show out of four at Radio City Music Hall and described their live rapport as energetic and humorous. Stephen Holden from The New York Times gave a positive review, praising their vocals and the development of the show. He also noticed the difference between the performers on stage, specifically \"Gaga's bright, saucy Broadway-trained voice and Mr. Bennett's mature saloon style\". In another positive review, Chicago Tribune Howard Reich stated \"Bennett and Gaga all but erased the decades separating them\". Joe Lynch from Billboard gave a rating of 4 stars for Gaga and Bennett's stand-out vocal performances; he praised Gaga's delivery of \"Bang Bang\" and \"La Vie en Rose\" describing it as \"astonished\".

He was educated at the University of Edinburgh. He was commissioned as a cornet in the 10th Dragoons in 1768, and promoted to lieutenant in 1772; he became a captain in the 1st Foot Guards in 1775 and lieutenant-colonel in 1777. He saw little or no active service and perhaps the most notable aspect of his army career was as an equerry to King George III from 1781 to 1797. This included the king's first bout of physical and mental illness, then known as madness, for which Greville's diaries are a valuable primary source. Some incidents from them were incorporated into the play The Madness of George III and its film adaptation - a fictionalised Greville appears in both of them, played in the film by Rupert Graves.\n",

    "text": "In 1995\u201396 Magle composed a symphonic Lego Fantasia in three movements for piano and symphony orchestra, commissioned by the Lego Group. It was premiered on 24 August 1997 at a concert in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by David Parry, with Magle himself on piano. In 1998 the same performers recorded the work for a CD released by the Lego Group. Also in 1998 he was commissioned to write a work for Amnesty International: he composed Flammer for Frihed (Flames for Freedom) for solo piano. The piece was printed in a book of the same title containing essays by 24 Danes (including then prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, former prime minister Poul Schl\u00fcter, T\u00f8ger Seidenfaden, Ghita N\u00f8rby, and others). Edited by Monica Ritterband, the book was published on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On 22 November 1998 Magle's Cantata to Saint Cecilia for soloists, choir, children's choir, and chamber orchestra was given its first performance at the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen. The following year it was recorded and released on the album C\u00e6ciliemusik (Music for Saint Cecilia) by the Danish C\u00e6ciliekoret (The Cecilia Choir) conducted by Gunnar Svensson with the soloists Birgitte Ewerl\u00f6f (soprano), Tuva Semmingsen (alto), and J\u00f8rgen Ditlevsen (bass). The cantata's text is by the author Iben Krogsdal; based on the story of Saint Cecilia, who died in a gruesome way for her Christian faith, it has been described as \"moderate modernism\" with a special \"Danish tone\" and a transparent chamber musical instrumentation.\n",

In 1767, he also discovered a new archipelago inside Saint George's Channel between New Ireland and New Britain Islands (Papua New Guinea) and named it Duke of York Islands, as well as rediscovered the Solomon Islands first sighted by the Spaniard \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a in 1568, and the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands first discovered by Juan Fern\u00e1ndez in 1574. Weakened by severe illness, he arrived back in England, at Spithead, on 20 March 1769, having been ably assisted by Lieutenant Erasmus Gower who was, for much of the voyage, the only fit person on board Swallow who could navigate.\n",

In the piece, which was titled \"Deadly Doctors\", McCaughey falsely asserted that presidential advisor Ezekiel Emanuel believed the disabled should not be entitled to medical care, and quoted him out of context. On July 27, excerpts from the McCaughey's op-ed were read, with approval, by Representative (Rep.) Michele Bachmann (R-MN) on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. Within days, Rep. John Boehner (R-OH), then the Minority Leader of the House and Rep. Thaddeus McCotter (R-MI), the Republican Policy Committee Chairman, repeated claims that Section 1233 would encourage \"government-sponsored\" euthanasia, and Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) charged that the proposal would \"put seniors in a position of being put to death by their government.\" On July 30, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, declared that the House bill had \"a bias toward euthanasia\". The Washington Post reported on August 1, 2009 that the claim had been spreading via \"religious e-mail lists\" and internet blogs. In early August, members of Congress held town hall meetings that were marked by hostility\u2014including shouting, sporadic, physical altercations and comparisons between the proposed reforms and Nazi Germany.\n",

After being sidelined from in-ring action due to a calf injury for his first week in Mexico, Devitt made his CMLL debut on 23 March, teaming with Marco Corleone and Rush in a six-man tag team main event, where they faced Mephisto, \u00daltimo Guerrero and Volador Jr. After pinning Volador Jr. for the win, Devitt challenged him to a match for the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship. On 30 March, Devitt defeated Volador Jr. to become the new NWA World Historic Middleweight Champion. On 3 May at Wrestling Dontaku 2012, Devitt lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship to Low Ki in his fifth defense, ending his second reign at 227 days. On 27 May, Devitt entered the 2012 Best of the Super Juniors tournament, which he started off with losses against Kushida and Taichi. Devitt bounced back, winning five out of his six remaining matches, including a win over Jyushin Thunder Liger in the final round-robin match of the tournament on 9 June, to finish second in his block and advance to the semifinals of the tournament. The following day, Devitt was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals by Low Ki. On 8 July, Devitt defeated Taichi to make his first successful defense of the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship. His second successful title defense took place on 29 July, when he defeated previous champion Volador Jr. in a rematch in the main event of a New Japan event in Korakuen Hall. On 12 September, Devitt returned to Mexico for another tour with CMLL. Devitt wrestled his first match back in CMLL two days later at the 79th Anniversary Show, where he, Atlantis and M\u00edstico II were defeated in a six-man tag team match by Drag\u00f3n Rojo Jr., Negro Casas and \u00daltimo Guerrero, when Rojo pinned Devitt for the win. On 21 September, Devitt was again pinned by Rojo in a six-man tag team match, where he teamed with Blue Panther and La Sombra to face Rojo, Mr. \u00c1guila and Taichi. Afterwards, Devitt accepted Rojo's challenge for the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship. On the 28 September CMLL Super Viernes show, Devitt lost the title to Rojo, ending his reign at 182 days.\n",

Her work received a variety of honors during her career including a diploma of honor from the Paris Colonial Exposition in 1931 and a bronze medal from the 1930 exhibition of the Society of Washington Artists. Her plaster bust of Theodore E. Burton is currently in the collection of the United States Capitol; she is also represented in the collections of the Western Reserve Historical Society, the United States Military Academy, the United States Naval Observatory, the Montana State Capitol, and Howard University.

The square is bounded by 4th Street to the west and 6th Street to the east. North and south of the park are the respective westbound and eastbound lanes of Seward Square, SE. Because Pennsylvania and North Carolina Avenues intersect in the middle of the square, it divides the square into four unique smaller parks. The park is named after William Henry Seward, the United States Secretary of State under Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. Seward is noted for his part in the American purchase of Alaska from the Russian Empire in 1867. The purchase was ridiculed at the time and was colloquially known as \"Seward's Folly\". There is no statue of William Seward on the site of the park, however there is a statue of his adopted daughter, Olive Risley Seward located at a private residence at the corner of 6th Street and North Carolina Avenue, SE. The statue was sculpted in 1971 by John Cavanaugh.\n",

    "text": "Cadman made his debut for Derbyshire in May 1900 with an unnotable performance in a match against Lancashire. He played in two further matches that year, making his bowling debut against Surrey when he took a single wicket. He played five matches in 1901 but missed a season in 1902. From 1903 he became a regular player, remaining a stalwart all-rounder until 1926, and in a match against Nottinghamshire he took five wickets for 42. In 1904 he scored his first century which was against Essex. He had a very successful bowling season in 1905 taking 5\u201394 against the Australians, 6\u201327 against Lancashire and 5\u201391 against Yorkshire. In a match against Warwickshire he took 5\u201346 and 6\u201346 in a convincing win for Derbyshire which brought his total wickets to 100, Billy Bestwick's to 550, and Levi Wright's run total to 11500. Over the next few years Derbyshire remained close to or at the bottom of the points table despite his 6\u201341 against Hampshire in 1907, and centuries against Warwickshire in 1908 and against Leicestershire in 1909 and 1911. In 1913 he took 7\u201339 against Essex and 6\u201327 against Somerset and scored another century against Leicestershire. In 1914 he scored a century against Worcestershire and took 6\u201327 against Lancashire.\n",

    "text": "Many of the major 15th- and 16th-century composers of the Franco-Flemish School\u2014a current of vocal polyphony that played a central role in European art music of the time\u2014were born and bred in the portion of the Low Countries that is situated in present-day Belgium, often in Hainaut. The late medieval composer and music theorist Johannes Ciconia (c.\u20091370\u20131412) had been born in Li\u00e8ge, but like many later Flemish polyphonists he spent much of his life working in Renaissance Italy. While it remains unclear why Flemish and other Netherlandish musicians exerted such a strong influence on Renaissance music throughout Europe (with a particularly strong axis developing between Li\u00e8ge and Rome), one possibility is the emphasis that was placed locally on music theory. Guillaume Dufay (c. 1397\u20131474), who was born near Brussels (he moved as a child to Cambrai, and also worked in Italy), was a key figure of the early 15th-century Burgundian School, and he was considered by his contemporaries to be the leading composer of the age. Another influential figure was Gilles Binchois (c. 1400\u20131460): probably born in Mons (or nearby Binche) he moved to Lille, the largest city of what is now French Flanders, and unlike many of his contemporaries, he maintained professional connections with the Burgundian court throughout his life. Johannes Ockeghem (c. 1410\u20131497) is also considered one of the leading composers of the 15th century; a native of Hainaut, he spent most of his career working for the French court.\n",

Pritsak began his academic career at the University of Lviv in interwar Poland where he studied Middle Eastern languages under local orientalists and became associated with the Shevchenko Scientific Society and attended its seminar on Ukrainian history led by Ivan Krypiakevych. After the Soviet annexation of Galicia, he moved to Kiev where he briefly studied with the premier Ukrainian orientalist, Ahatanhel Krymsky. During the war, Pritsak escaped to the west. He studied at the universities in Berlin and G\u00f6ttingen, receiving a doctorate from the latter, before teaching at the University of Hamburg. In the 1960s, he moved to the United States, where he taught at the University of Washington for a while, before moving to Harvard at the invitation of the prominent linguist, Roman Jakobson, who was interested in proving the authenticity of the twelfth century \"Song of Igor\" through the use of oriental sources. At Harvard, he founded the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute (1973), became the first Mykhailo Hrushevsky Professor of Ukrainian History (1975), and started the journal, Harvard Ukrainian Studies (1977). In 1989, he retired from his Harvard professorship. After the emergence of an independent Ukraine in 1991, Pritsak returned to Kiev where he founded the Oriental Institute of the National Academy of Sciences and the journal Skhidnyi svit (The Oriental World). He spent his final years back in the United States and died in Boston at the age of 87.\n",

    "text": "The first video games that used pseudo-3D were primarily arcade games, the earliest known examples dating back to the mid-1970s, when they began using microprocessors. In 1975, Taito released Interceptor, an early first-person shooter and combat flight simulator that involved piloting a jet fighter, using an eight-way joystick to aim with a crosshair and shoot at enemy aircraft that move in formations of two and increase/decrease in size depending on their distance to the player. In 1976, Sega released Moto-Cross, an early black-and-white motorbike racing video game, based on the motocross competition, that was most notable for introducing an early three-dimensional third-person perspective. Later that year, Sega-Gremlin re-branded the game as Fonz, as a tie-in for the popular sitcom, Happy Days. Both versions of the game displayed a constantly changing forward-scrolling road and the player's bike in a third-person perspective where objects nearer to the player are larger than those nearer to the horizon, and the aim was to steer the vehicle across the road, racing against the clock, while avoiding any on-coming motorcycles or driving off the road. That same year also saw the release of two arcade games that extended the car driving subgenre into three dimensions with a first-person perspective: Sega's Road Race, which displayed a constantly changing forward-scrolling S-shaped road with two obstacle race cars moving along the road that the player must avoid crashing while racing against the clock, and Atari's Night Driver, which presented a series of posts by the edge of the road though there was no view of the road or the player's car. Games using vector graphics had an advantage in creating pseudo-3D effects. 1979's Speed Freak recreated the perspective of Night Driver in greater detail.\n",

Then, 3d Battalion landed on Ennuebing with the mission of supporting the landing on Roi-Namur. During the landing, two 75mm howitzers were lost and four Marines died after two LVTs (Landing Vehicles, Tracked) sank; 3d Battalion surgeon Lieutenant Irad B. Hardy, Jr., USN, received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for repeatedly swimming out to the floundering LVTs in order to assist Marines and Sailors. Third Battalion began firing on enemy Japanese positions on Roi (the western half of the Roi-Namur island) at 6:58am on 1 February in support of 2d Battalion, 23d Marines. Roi was quickly taken by 23d Marines. The successful assault was largely due to supporting arms, including artillery from 3/14; after the battle it was estimated that supporting arms produced 60% of Japanese KIAs on Roi. Third Battalion embarked upon the USS La Salle, USS Sheridan, and USS Calvert, departing from the Kwajalein Atoll on 5 February and arriving at Maui, Territory of Hawaii on 16 February. While at Maui, 3d Battalion rested and refitted, received replacements, conducted training, and rearmed with M2A1 (M101A1) 105mm cannons.\n",

The Polish army then peacefully entered the town and Adam Wilkanowski became the commander in the castle. In 1455 a Teutonic attack was repulsed and Nibork remained within Poland for the rest of the war. The incorporation of Nibork to Poland was confirmed in the peace treaty signed in Toru\u0144 in 1466, but two years later the town came under Teutonic rule, remaining under Polish suzerainty as a fief. It then became part of the Duchy of Prussia, also a vassal state of Poland, after the secularization of the Order's Prussian territories in 1525. After 1525, Nibork was capital of the county, whose first administrator was Piotr Kobierzycki, a local Polish nobleman. In 1549 the Czech Brethren settled in Nibork. In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Polish pastors from Nibork published their works and translations in both Nibork and K\u00f6nigsberg (Kr\u00f3lewiec). In 1656 the town was unsuccessfully besieged during the Northern Wars. The city suffered from fires in 1656, 1664, 1784 and 1804.\n",

After temporary stay in Belgium, Pryli\u0144ski settled in Krak\u00f3w in 1872. Initially, he worked as land surveyor for the Bank of Galicia in 1873. Soon later, he began to work as architect and construction engineer. He specialized in the Renaissance and embarked on the first ever photo-documentation of the deteriorating Wawel Castle, the traditional seat of Polish monarchs built at the behest of Casimir III the Great. He conducted conservation work at the Church of St. Franciszek Salezy and at the Bishop's Palace in Krak\u00f3w between 1881 and 1884. Commissioned by the patriotic Mayor Miko\u0142aj Zyblikiewicz, in 1875 Pryli\u0144ski began the restoration of Sukiennice (largely abandoned by Imperial Vienna) with the new Sukiennice Museum upstairs. The project was successfully completed and inaugurated with a ceremonial ball of October 3, 1879.\n",

Following the inconclusive Battle of Beaver Dam Creek (Mechanicsville) the previous day, Confederate General Robert E. Lee renewed his attacks against the right flank of the Union Army, relatively isolated on the northern side of the Chickahominy River. There, Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps had established a strong defensive line behind Boatswain's Swamp. Lee's force was destined to launch the largest Confederate attack of the war, about 57,000 men in six divisions. Porter's reinforced V Corps held fast for the afternoon as the Confederates attacked in a disjointed manner, first with the division of Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill, then Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, suffering heavy casualties. The arrival of Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's command was delayed, preventing the full concentration of Confederate force before Porter received some reinforcements from the VI Corps.\n",

Unable to make a breakthrough but possessed of a promising voice and stage presence, she was encouraged by music critics to get formal training. She became a pupil of Marcelliano Marcello who had opened a singing school in Turin and went on to further training with Carlo Boniforti at the Milan Conservatory. She made rapid progress and by the early 1850s was signed to various northern Italian opera houses as the prima donna assoluta. She had a triumphant debut at the Teatro Regio in Turin in 1854 in the title role of Donizetti's Gemma di Vergy. Later in her career she also sang the title roles in his La Favorita, Lucrezia Borgia, and Anna Bolena. She went on to sing many leading roles in Verdi's operas, including some of the earliest performances of his La traviata (as Violetta), Rigoletto (as Gilda) and Il trovatore (as Leonora). She also appeared in Verdi's I masnadieri (as Amalia), Nabucco (as Abigaille), Macbeth (as Lady Macbeth), Attila (as Odabella), Ballo in Maschera (as Amelia), and I due Foscari (as Lucrezia).\n",

In the Cheshire County League, success eluded them for several years before they won the title in 1972. On the dissolution of the Cheshire County League in 1982, Rhyl became members of the North West Counties League, winning promotion to the Northern Premier League in their first season. In 1992, they reluctantly decided to join the League of Wales but, because their application was received too late, they were placed instead in the Cymru Alliance, the second level of the pyramid system.

(now Sherritt International) of Sherridon and Lynn Lake Manitoba Canada, based on the older Forward process developed by Dr. Frank Forward for the recovery of copper and nickel from those same mines. Nickel sulfide concentrates can be treated by either roasting or flash smelting to produce matte from which nickel and cobalt can be recovered hydrometallurgically, or they may be treated by an ammonia solution pressure leach. The residue is removed. A feed of matte and sulfide concentrate containing approximately 0.4% cobalt and 30% sulfur is pressure leached at elevated temperature and pressure in an ammoniacal solution to produce a solution of nickel, copper and cobalt. By boiling away the ammonia; copper is precipitated as a sulfide and sent to a smelter. Hydrogen sulfide is added to the autoclave to remove nickel sulfide and copper sulfide which is fed back to the leaching process. Air is then passed through the solution in the autoclave for oxyhydrolysis. The solution is then reduced with hydrogen, again at high temperature and pressure, to precipitate nickel powder (>99%). The remaining solution (containing approximately equal proportions of nickel and cobalt sulfides), is then adjusted (to a lower temperature and pressure) to precipitate the mixed sulfides and the fluid is concentrated and crystallized into ammonium sulfate ((NH)SO). The mixed sulfides are pressure leached with air and sulfuric acid. Ammonia is then added to remove potassium and iron as jarosite (KFe (OH)(SO)). More ammonia and air is added for oxidation. The solution is removed from the autoclave and sulfuric acid added to remove nickel as nickel(II) sulfate-ammonium sulfate hexahydrate ((NiSO)\u2022((NH)SO)\u20226HO) which is then sent to have its nickel recovered. The solution is then further reduced with more sulfuric acid and cobalt metal powder is added to aid in the nucleation of precipitants (seeding). Addition of hydrogen gas to saturation precipitates cobalt powder with a purity of approximately 99.6%.\n",

It had two infantry brigades (each with two infantry regiments), along with an artillery brigade, a machine-gun brigade, and a headquarters detachment. During the reorganization, the 23rd New York was converted into the 106th Infantry Regiment under the command of COL Franklin W. Ward, and it was assigned to the 53rd Infantry Brigade (now the 53rd Troop Command) alongside the 105th Infantry Regiment. When the regiment arrived in France, it had an operational strength of 3,003 officers and enlisted men, and it was moved into the front lines on 25 June 1918. The regiment relieved elements of the British 6th Division along the East Poperinghe Line in Belgium, where it remained with the other elements of the 27th Division. On 31 August 1918, the Ypres-Lys Offensive began, and the 106th Regiment was engaged in the reconnaissance efforts prior to the main battle. Alongside the 53rd Brigade and the rest of the 27th Division, the 106th attacked German position in the Second Somme Offensive from 24 September to 21 October 1918.This offensive proved to be the decisive action which broke the Hindenburg Line. The desperate fighting is clearly demonstrated by the actions of LTC J. Leslie Kincaid, the Judge Advocate of the Division Staff. From 25\u201328 September, LTC Kincaid took command of a leaderless battalion of the 106th Infantry and managed to hold off an enemy counterattack by organizing every man in the battalion including runners, cooks, signalmen, etc. in the defense; he even personally manned a Lewis Gun during the action. He was awarded the British Distinguished Service Order. On 21 October 1918, the entire division was relieved from front line duty, and returned to the US on 19 March 1919. The regiment was mustered out, and was recast as the 186th Field Artillery Regiment. By the end of its combat action in World War I, the 106th Infantry Regiment suffered 1,955 casualties including 1,496 wounded, 376 killed, and 83 who later died of their wounds.\n",

In 1964 all the hovercraft businesses under Westland were merged with Vickers-Armstrongs to form the British Hovercraft Corporation. This, in turn, was taken over by Westland and was renamed Westland Aerospace in 1985, and hovercraft production was reduced to nearly nothing until the advent of the AP1-88. The company produced sub contract work for Britten-Norman, produced composites and component parts for the aircraft industry, especially engine nacelles for many aircraft including the De Havilland Canada \"Dash 8\", the Lockheed Hercules, the British Aerospace Jetstream and parts for the McDonnell-Douglas MD-11. By the mid-1990s, over 60% of the world's production of turboprop nacelles took place in the East Cowes works.\n",

He assembled a squadron of eleven gunboats and other vessels and, at the Second Battle of the Taku Forts, he led an assault on the forts at the mouth of the river in June 1859 in a resumption of the Second Opium War. However the forts had been strengthened and the squadron encountered firm resistance from the Chinese defenders: Hope was forced to retreat. In addition to the loss of three British gunboats and some British prestige, a total of 89 British officers and men were killed and 345 were wounded. During the engagement Commodore Josiah Tattnall, commanding the steamer Toey-Wan of the United States Navy, a neutral party in the war, provided assistance with the evacuation of the dead and wounded, justifying his involvement with the comment \"blood is thicker than water\".

In 1658 the company moved to Paris and, after a successful performance on 24 October 1658 in front of Louis XIV at the Louvre, was allowed to share the large hall in the H\u00f4tel du Petit-Bourbon with the Italian players of Tiberio Fiorillo. At this time Moli\u00e8re's company became known as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Monsieur, since their official sponsor was the King's brother Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, known as Monsieur. When the Petit Bourbon was demolished in 1660 to make way for the eastern expansion of the Louvre, Moli\u00e8re's troupe was allowed to use the abandoned Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Palais-Royal. The latter theatre had originally been built by Cardinal Richelieu in 1641. After Moli\u00e8re's death in 1673, his widow Armande B\u00e9jart and the actor La Grange kept the remnants of the company together, merging with the players from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais and moving to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Gu\u00e9n\u00e9gaud.

    "text": "Crust punk groups, such as Antisect, Sacrilege and Anti System took some influence from early black metal bands like Venom, Hellhammer, and Celtic Frost, while Amebix's lead vocalist and guitarist sent his band's early demo tape to Cronos of Venom, who replied by saying \"We\u2019ll rip you off\". Similarly, Bathory was initially inspired by crust punk as well as heavy metal. Crust punk was affected by a second wave of black metal in the 1990s, with some bands emphasizing these black metal elements. Iskra are probably the most obvious example of second wave black metal-influenced crust punk; Iskra coined their own phrase \"blackened crust\" to describe their new style. The Japanese group Gallhammer also fused crust punk with black metal while the English band Fukpig has been said to have elements of crust punk, black metal, and grindcore. Germany's Downfall of Gaia has been described as mixing crustgrind and black metal, along with elements of sludge metal, doom metal and post-metal. North Carolina's Young and in the Way have been playing blackened crust since their formation in 2009. In addition, Norwegian band Darkthrone have incorporated crust punk traits in their more recent material. As Daniel Ekeroth wrote in 2008,\n",

In a January 13, 2006 interview on the Tavis Smiley Show, Nagin himself denied these rumors, stating that he \"never was a Republican\" and that he has been a \"life-long Democrat\", and several news organizations that reported he was a Republican issued retractions. He periodically gave contributions to candidates of both parties, including Representative Billy Tauzin in 1999 and 2000, as well as Democrat Senators John Breaux and J. Bennett Johnston, Jr. earlier in the decade. Nagin endorsed conservative Republican Bobby Jindal over conservative Democrat Lieutenant Governor Kathleen Blanco in the 2003 runoff for governor.\n",

    "text": "The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning (also known as The Little Mermaid III in the working title) is a 2008 American animated direct-to-video fantasy film produced by DisneyToon Studios, and a prequel to Disney's 1989 animated film The Little Mermaid. Directed by Peggy Holmes, the film's story is set before the events of the original film, when Ariel is still young, and where all music has been banned from the underwater kingdom of Atlantica by King Triton after being heartbroken at his wife's death, and Ariel attempts to challenge this law. Jodi Benson and Samuel E. Wright reprise their roles as Ariel and Sebastian respectively, while Sally Field voices the film's new villain, Marina Del Rey, and Jim Cummings replaces Kenneth Mars as King Triton, as Mars had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and was unable to reprise the role. The film was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on August 26, 2008. The film received negative reviews with criticism aimed at the script and the music score, but the animation quality was praised.\n",

He worked as a schoolmaster in Texas for six years. At twenty-two, in 1889 he returned to Wales to work at Rhyl school. After teaching for two years he decided to go on a Christian mission. He started preaching and entered Bala Preparatory School (for missionaries) at Bala, Gwynedd. Then he joined Bala-Bangor Theological Seminary in 1896. He completed the course in 1898 becoming the topper in all examinations. He was selected by the Board of Calvinistic Methodist Mission to be missionary for Mizoram (then Lushai Hills), India. At the same time his brother John was also selected by the mission board for South America. Rowlands was ordained in the church assembly at Newport in 1898. The two brothers set sail from Liverpool on the same day but in opposite directions. While at the Arabian Sea, Rowlands received a tragic message that John had perished in the Atlantic Ocean in a ship wreck. It was later reported that John sacrificed himself for others by refusing to board a limited life boat. Despite his mother plea he received at Calcutta to return home, there was no turning back for Rowlands.\n",

On 13 August 2008, Vyeramko was one of the key players for BATE Borisov in the Belarusians' away game against Bulgarian side Levski Sofia (third qualifying round of the Champions League), parrying a Georgi Ivanov shot from the penalty spot (the penalty kick had been awarded after a Veremko foul on Georgi Hristov) and making a number of other notable saves to deny the Levski Sofia forwards. The match ended 0:1 and a 1:1 home draw in Barysaw was sufficient to see the Belarusians progress to the group stages of the Champions League for the first time in their history. (Vyeramko did not play in the home leg due to a suspension attributable to accumulated yellow cards). However, Vyeramko was the starting goalkeeper in all of his team's games in the UEFA Champions League group stage, earning himself 1 yellow card during the Belarusians' 1:1 away draw against FC Zenit Saint Petersburg on 21 October 2008 (after a mild altercation with Portuguese forward Danny). On 9 April 2009, Vyeramko was shown a red card in the 17th minute of BATE Borisov's 0:1 away loss to FC Naftan Novopolotsk in a Belarusian Cup game for handling the ball outside his penalty area.\n",

    "text": "The name Steppenwolf has become notable in popular culture for various organizations and establishments. In 1967, the band Steppenwolf, headed by German-born singer John Kay, took their name from the novel. The Belgian band DAAU (Die Anarchistische Abendunterhaltung) is named after one of the advertising slogans of the novel's magical theatre. The innovative Magic Theatre Company, founded in 1967 in Berkeley and which later became resident in San Francisco, takes its name from the \"Magic Theatre\" of the novel, and the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago, founded in 1974 by actors Terry Kinney, Jeff Perry, and Gary Sinise, took its name from the novel. The lengthy track \"Steppenwolf\" appears on English rock band Hawkwind's album Astounding Sounds, Amazing Music and is directly inspired by the novel, including references to the magic theatre and the dual nature of the wolfman-manwolf (lutocost). Robert Calvert had initially written and performed the lyrics on \"Distances Between Us\" by Adrian Wagner in 1974. The song also appears on later, live Hawkwind CDs and DVDs. Danish acid rock band Steppeulvene (1967\u201368) also took their name from this novel. \"He Was a Steppenwolf\" is a song by Boney M. from the album Nightflight to Venus.\n",

            "text": "The album retells the events in The Silmarillion, beginning with an episode at the end:\n1. In \"War of Wrath\", Sauron advises his master Morgoth to flee the triumphant Valar in the War of Wrath. Morgoth sends him away and reflects on the events leading up to his defeat.\n2. In \"Into the Storm\", Morgoth and Ungoliant, fleeing from Valinor after having destroyed the Two Trees, struggle for the possession of the Silmarils.\n3. \"Lammoth\" is the Morgoth's scream of fear. It summons his Balrogs to his aid to fight off Ungoliant.\n4. In \"Nightfall\", F\u00ebanor and his seven sons mourn the destruction wrought by Morgoth, including the slaying of Finw\u00eb, F\u00ebanor's father, and swear to get revenge on him, in spite of the Valar's disapproval.\n5. \"The Minstrel\" is most likely about Maglor, son of F\u00ebanor, who composed the song \"The Fall of the Noldor\" based on the Kinslaying.\n6. In \"The Curse of F\u00ebanor\", F\u00ebanor expresses his wrath and anger and relates the misdeeds he commits, especially the Kinslaying, in pursuit of Morgoth.\n7. In \"Captured\", Morgoth addresses the captive Maedhros, F\u00ebanor's son, and chains him to the Thangorodrim mountains.\n8. In \"Blood Tears\", Maedhros relates the horrors of his captivity and his deliverance by Fingon.\n9. \"Mirror Mirror\" recounts how Turgon, in view of inevitable defeat, builds the city of Gondolin, aided by Ulmo (\"The Lord of Water\").\n10. In \"Face the Truth\", Fingolfin reflects about the destiny of the Noldor.\n11. In \"Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)\", Fingolfin recounts his Noldor army's passage from the icy waste of Helcarax\u00eb and the prophecy by Mandos about the Noldor's fate; he reflects on his own and his people's guilt and foreshadows their ultimate defeat.\n12. \"The Battle of Sudden Flame\" refers to the battle in which Morgoth breaks the Siege of Angband using his Balrogs and dragons. The lyrics tell of how Barahir of the House of B\u00ebor, with great loss to his own company, saved the life of the Elven king Finrod Felagund, and in return Finrod swore an oath of friendship to Barahir and all of his kin.\n13. \"Time Stands Still (At the Iron Hill)\" is about Fingolfin riding to the gates of Angband to challenge Morgoth to a duel. Fingolfin wounds Morgoth seven times but is eventually killed.\n14. \"The Dark Elf\" refers to E\u00f6l who seduced Turgon's sister and fathered Maeglin, who would eventually betray Gondolin.\n15. \"Thorn\" is a song describing Maeglin's captivity in Angband and Morgoth trying to convert Maeglin to his side with threats and lies. The title of the song refers to the thorn bushes that hid the outer gates of Gondolin.\n16. \"The Eldar\" is Elven king Finrod Felagund's farewell to his people, dying from wounds sustained by saving his human friend Beren from a werewolf, thereby fulfilling his oath to the House of B\u00ebor.\n17. In \"Nom the Wise\", Beren mourns his friend Finrod. N\u00f3m means \"wise\" and was the name given to Finrod by Beren's forefather B\u00ebor.\n18. In \"When Sorrow Sang\", Beren sings about his love to the Elven princess L\u00fathien and his death at the teeth of Morgoth's wolf Carcharoth. Last part is about Mandos listening to Luthien's song about their grief experienced by being different in kin.\n19. \"Out on the Water\" refers to the last dwelling-place of Beren and L\u00fathien.\n20. In \"The Steadfast\", Morgoth curses his captive H\u00farin (known in Elvish as the Steadfast) who refused to reveal the secret of Gondolin.\n21. In \"A Dark Passage\", Morgoth ponders his triumph in the fifth battle. The song also relates the origins of the kindred of men and Morgoth's curse on H\u00farin to be witness to his children's tragic fate.\n22. \"Final Chapter (Thus ends ...)\" concludes the album, speaking of Morgoth's victory by the \"treachery of man\" but also of the hope for a new day.\n23. \"Harvest of Sorrow\" is a bonus track on the 2007 and 2018 remastered versions of the album. T\u00farin mourns the loss of his sister Ni\u00ebnor.\n24. \"Doom\" is a bonus track on the 2018 remastered version of the album. The track shows a more detailed account of H\u00farin being cursed by Morgoth. A slightly rewritten version appears on a limited edition of Beyond the Red Mirror as an epilogue chapter.\n25. \"The Tides of War\" is a bonus track on the 2018 remastered version of the album. The track tells of the rebellious Noldor arriving in Beleriand to face Morgoth, thinking also about the burning of the Teleri ships at Losgar and the Oath of F\u00ebanor.",

Blind Guardian has written many songs relating to Middle-earth, including the full concept album Nightfall in Middle Earth. Almost the entire discography of Battlelore are Tolkien-themed. Summoning's music is based upon Tolkien and holds the distinction of the being the only artist to have crafted a song entirely in the Black Speech of Mordor. Gorgoroth, Cirith Ungol and Amon Amarth take their names from an area of Mordor, and Burzum take their name from the Black Speech of Mordor. The Finnish metal band Nightwish and the Norwegian metal band Tristania have also incorporated many Tolkien references into their music. American heavy metal band Megadeth released two songs titled \"This Day We Fight!\" and \"How the Story Ends\", which were both inspired by The Lord of the Rings. German folk metal band Eichenschild is named for Thorin Oakenshield, a character in The Hobbit, and naturally has a number of Tolkien-themed songs. They are not to be confused with the '70s folk rock band Thorin Eichenschild.\n",

He decided that his mission should go abroad in 1977, and after meeting with Mother Teresa's Sisters of Mercy in Rome, he flew to Yemen to work with lepers. After four years in Yemen, he was jailed and subsequently deported. He then went to Calcutta, India, to work directly with Mother Teresa. From 1993 to 1996 he headed the Catholic Relief Services mission in Liberia, a period which brought him into contact with Liberian President and Dictator, Charles Taylor. He returned to the United States in 1996, and became pastor at St. Richard's Catholic Church in 1998. In 2007, he was transferred to St. Benedict The Moor Church and St. Therese of the Child Jesus, where he served until his retirement in 2011. All three are located in North Omaha.\n",

He was deployed out of position at right back, and was replaced by Gary Neville at half-time after injuring himself while setting up Alan Shearer's third goal of the match. The injury was not serious and he was able to make his second England appearance four days later, coming on as a late substitute for Steve McManaman in a 0\u20130 draw with Poland. England qualified for the Euro 2000 competition but Dyer was not selected for the squad for the tournament, though he had recovered from injury and taken part in pre-tournament friendlies against Argentina and Ukraine. Along with a number of other young players who failed to make the squad \u2013 including Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard, Michael Duberry, Jody Morris and Jonathan Woodgate \u2013 Dyer took a drunken holiday to the Cypriot resort of Ayia Napa. The holiday hit the headlines when a video of Dyer, Ferdinand and Lampard having sex with a number of women was leaked to The News of the World. Shortly after the story broke, it was revealed that Dyer had spent a night in hospital after being glassed in the face during a fight in an Ipswich night club.\n",

The mainly cast iron parapet ribs have a wrought iron central section of . The central pier stands high and the bridge was built higher than its predecessor so that the Halifax and Ovenden Joint Railway could pass underneath the northern end.

    "text": "In 1878 Depelchin was recalled to Europe by Beckx, who assigned him to organise and head the Zambesi Mission in southeastern Africa. The Mission was to cover, in today's maps, all of Zimbabwe, most of Zambia and some of Mozambique. At that time, very few Europeans knew anything about that part of Africa. But finding funds and volunteers were not a problem. In 1879, Depelchin sailed for Cape Town in the Cape Colony with an international team of five other priests and five lay brothers from various Jesuit provinces. They then went to the Zambezia bush to establish a mission base in Bulawayo in Matabeleland (now western Zimbabwe). The journey took almost six months. It was the first of three successive expeditions, taken between 1879 and 1882, Each of them began in the town of Grahamstown (about from the coast), also in the Cape Colony, and involved hundreds of miles (kilometers) in ox-carts in a painful climate and through a hostile environment. The goal was always the same \u2013 to ask the natives for the permission to open a mission station in their land. But, each time, they said no. Each time, Depelchin and his men were dogged by misfortunes, trails, diseases, accidents and even probably poison. His letters sent \"from the lands of the Matabeles\", \"in the huts of the Batongas\" and from \"the valley of the Barotses\", were published in Brussels as a two-volume set in 1882 and 1883. Under the title of Trois ans dans l'Afrique australe [Three Years in Southern Africa], the collection was an immediate best-seller, drawing more missionary vocations to the Church.\n",

After youthful studies in Antwerp with the architect-sculptor Jacques du Broeucq, he moved to Italy in 1550 and studied in Rome, making a detailed study of the sculpture of classical antiquity. He was also much influenced by Michelangelo, but developed his own Mannerist style, with perhaps less emphasis on emotion and more emphasis on refined surfaces, cool elegance, and beauty. Pope Pius IV gave Giambologna his first major commission, the colossal bronze Neptune and subsidiary figures for the Fountain of Neptune (the base designed by Tommaso Laureti, 1566) in Bologna. Giambologna spent his most productive years in Florence, where he had settled in 1553. In 1563 he was named a member (Accademico) of the prestigious Accademia delle Arti del Disegno, just founded by the Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, on 13 January 1563, under the influence of the painter-architect Giorgio Vasari, becoming also one of the Medicis' most important court sculptors. He died in Florence at the age of 79; the Medici had never allowed him to leave Florence, as they rightly feared that either the Austrian or Spanish Habsburgs would entice him into permanent employment. He was interred in a chapel he designed himself in the Santissima Annunziata.\n",

During the offseason, the team acquired Joe Johnson from the Phoenix Suns, and signed free agent Zaza Pachulia. However, tragedy struck as center Jason Collier suffered a heart attack during the preseason and died suddenly on October 15. The Hawks would stumble out of the gate again losing their first nine games, on their way to an awful 2\u201316 start. However, they would play better in December winning five of their next seven games, including a win over the defending champion San Antonio Spurs, 94\u201384 on December 10. The Hawks played .500 basketball in February, which included a 99\u201398 victory over the Detroit Pistons on February 7.

    "text": "T32 was ordered on 20 January 1941 from Schichau, laid down at their Elbing, East Prussia, shipyard on 27 October 1942 as yard number 1514, launched on 17 April 1943 and commissioned on 8 May 1944. Working up until August, T32 was then assigned to the 6th Torpedo Boat Flotilla operating in the Baltic. The flotilla, consisting of T32 as the flotilla leader, and her sisters T22 and T30, was tasked to lay a minefield in Narva Bay on the night of 17/18 August. Reinforced by their sister T23 from the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, the boats loaded 54 mines in Helsinki, Finland, and departed on the evening of the 17th. Shortly after midnight, they started to lay their mines, but had only just begun when T30 struck a pair of mines about 00:25 which knocked out her power and gave her a list to port. About a minute after that T32 also struck a pair of mines that blew her bow off and disabled her engines. At 00:30 T30 exploded and broke in half, probably after hitting another mine. T22 struck a pair of mines while maneuvering to go alongside T32 and blew up at around 01:14. The Germans thought that she had been torpedoed by the Soviet motor torpedo boats that they believed were present and T23s captain ordered his boat to leave the area without rescuing any of the survivors in the water or aboard T32. The ship was sunk by Soviet aircraft after dawn at with the loss of 137 crewmen after T23s departure. The Soviets never claimed to have torpedoed any of the boats that night and naval historian Michael J. Whitley believes that the most likely explanation is that they accidentally entered a nearby German minefield, either through their own errors in navigation or because the minefield was misplotted when laid.\n",

Grandi told Ciano that the king must be either \"crazy\" and/or \"senile\" as he was utterly passive, refusing to act against Mussolini. In late 1942, Italian Libya was lost. During Operation Anton on 9 November 1942, the unoccupied part of France was occupied by the Axis forces, which allowed Victor Emmanuel to proclaim in a speech at long last Corsica and Nice had been \"liberated\". Early in 1943, the ten divisions of the \"Italian Army in Russia\" (Armata Italiana in Russia, or ARMIR) were crushed in a side-action in the Battle of Stalingrad. By the middle of 1943, the last Italian forces in Tunisia had surrendered and Sicily had been taken by the Allies. Hampered by lack of fuel as well as several serious defeats, the Italian Navy spent most of the war confined to port. As a result, the Mediterranean Sea was not in any real sense Italy's Mare Nostrum. While the Air Force generally did better than the Army or the Navy, it was chronically short of modern aircraft.\n",

It was released on July 25, 2006, and charted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The album was produced by former Traveling Wilburys bandmate Jeff Lynne, who also produced Petty\u2019s highly acclaimed first solo album, Full Moon Fever, as well as the Heartbreakers' next album Into the Great Wide Open. Petty released the album through Rick Rubin's American Recordings label and Warner Bros. Records, where Petty has had a record contract since his second solo album, Wildflowers (which was produced by Rubin). The tracks \"Saving Grace\" and \"Big Weekend\" were released July 4, 2006 on the iTunes Music Store. It ended up being Petty's only album for American Recordings, as that label moved to Columbia Records distribution in 2007; Warner Bros. retained the rights to Petty, eventually reassigning him to subsidiary label Reprise Records.\n",

Over the next few years, living with her husband, she was employed in a succession of relatively low profile party jobs. Till the end of 1928 she worked for the party leadership in the Berlin district of Neuk\u00f6lln. After her marriage broke up in 1928 there were further political differences with party comrades and she offered her services to \"Red Aid\", the Communist-sponsored international welfare organisation. In this capacity she ran a children's home in Worpswede (north of Bremen) and then another, far to the south, at Elgersburg until it was forced to close through lack of funds. After this she worked as a regional party secretary in the Saar region, an area of Germany with an ambiguous status and still, at this stage, occupied by the French army. She was very soon moved to a job with the regional party leadership (\"Bezirksleitung\") in the Ruhr district and during 1931/32, worked as regional secretary for \"Red Aid\" in the large Baden-Palatinate region. In 1933 she became a member of the Central Executive of \"Red Aid\".\n",

    "text": "In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast region. The Superdome was used as an emergency, temporary shelter for displaced residents. The stadium suffered damage from the hurricane (notably from flooding and part of the roof being torn off as well as internal damage from lack of available facilities). The Saints were forced to play their first scheduled home game against the New York Giants at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey (the Giants' home stadium); other home games were rescheduled at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas or Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. During the season, it was rumored that Saints' owner Tom Benson might deem the Superdome unusable and seek to legally void his contract and relocate the team to San Antonio, where he had business interests. Ultimately, however, the Superdome was repaired and renovated in time for the 2006 season at an estimated cost of US$185 million. The New Orleans Saints' first post-Katrina home game was an emotionally charged Monday Night Football game versus their division rival, the Atlanta Falcons. The Saints, under rookie head coach Sean Payton and new quarterback Drew Brees, defeated the Falcons 23\u20133, and went on to notch the second playoff win in franchise history.\n",

Under Cole (who had previously coached in South Australia in the 1970s), the 36ers became one of the league's premier teams. Import players including 6'9\" (207\u00a0cm) centre Bill Jones, New York-born combo guard Al Green (who had been drafted by the San Diego Chargers as a Defensive back in the 1979 NFL Draft despite not playing football) and an NBL rookie in 24-year-old Power forward from Philadelphia, Mark Davis who joined the team 5 games into the season after dominating the local league with South Adelaide, combined with local players Darryl Pearce, team captain Peter Ali, young gun Mike McKay, and veteran Ray Wood to help Adelaide to a 20\u20136 record and second on the regular season ladder behind the Brian Kerle coached Brisbane Bullets who featured Australian Olympian Larry Sengstock, arguably the league's best player and former West Adelaide championship player Leroy Loggins, Ronnie \"The Rat\" Radliff, and the \"Black Pearl\" Cal Bruton. The team had a bye going into the semi-final where they easily defeated for the Newcastle Falcons 151\u2013103 at home in what the then record semi-final win in the NBL, something Ken Cole had publicly predicted would happen. Leading 105\u201384 going into the last period, Cole told his team that he wanted a record score for a Semi-final and the team responded, producing a 46\u201319 last period to blow the Falcons away and get the record. In the last single game NBL grand final ever played, Adelaide were up against the Brisbane Bullets on the Bullets' home court (Sleeman Sports Centre). Going into the final period the game the Bullets' were leading 78\u201374 but a 42\u201321 last period in favour of the home team with Loggins leading the way saw Adelaide fail to win their first grand final going down 95\u2013120.\n",

    "text": "Perkins was born on 15 November 1866 at Badminton, Gloucestershire and was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, St. Albans \u2013 his father, Rev Charles Perkins, was the headmaster \u2013 and at Merchant Taylors' School before obtaining a scholarship in classics to Jesus College, Oxford in 1885. After two years of studying classics, he switched to reading Natural History, notwithstanding that he had not studied science at school, having been inspired to make the change by the lectures of Edward Poulton on the colour of insects. His first publications in natural history journals came when he was still studying classics. He obtained a fourth-class degree in the Animal Morphology specialism of the Natural Sciences course in 1889. In 1891, a committee appointed by the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science asked Perkins to investigate the land fauna of the Hawaiian islands, and he was engaged in this for almost ten years, conducting research on the islands and carrying out studies at the University of Cambridge on his trips back home. The fruits of this research first began to be published in 1899, in Fauna Hawaiiensis (edited by David Sharp), and he completed his work in 1913 with a general introduction to the series. For this work, he was awarded the Linnean Society's gold medal for eminent services to zoology.\n",

About his preparation for the role, Choi said, \"[I] did a lot of WWII research especially in regards to the 'Nisei' soldiers, or Japanese-American soldiers. I wanted to get as much true, real-life information for a guy like Jim Morita fighting in WWII. I felt that if I had built a factual basis for him, I could then let go and permit the character to exist in the Marvel Universe, which allows for a lot of imaginative circumstances.\" Bruno Ricci stars as Jacques Dernier, a French member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Ricci auditioned for and got the part while filming the French series The Hawk. JJ Feild appears as James Montgomery Falsworth, a British member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Feild called his part in the film \"a very physical job. I play one of the Captain's sidekicks so I've been running around shooting things and blowing things up and trying to look cool for about a year.\" Additionally, Toby Jones was cast as Arnim Zola, a biochemist for the Nazi party, Richard Armitage portrays Heinz Kruger, the Red Skull's top assassin, Lex Shrapnel portrays Gilmore Hodge, a candidate for the super soldier program, Michael Brandon portrays Brandt, a United States Senator who recognizes the PR potential of Captain America. Jeff Goldblum had originally been approached to play the part; he later played Grandmaster in .

Shirvan's large Muslim population rose against Georgia. This probably happened in 1129 or 1130, when Demetrius restored the Shirvanshahs to power in Shirvan, installing on the throne Manuchihr II, the husband of his daughter Rusudan. Shirvanshahs had to provide the Georgian king with troops whenever the latter demanded it. In 1130 Georgia was attacked by the Sultan of Ahlat, Shah-Armen S\u00f6kmen II (1128-1183). This war was started by the passage of Ani into the hands of the Georgians; Demetrius I had to compromise and give up Ani to Fadl ibn Mahmud on terms of vassalage and inviolability of the Christian churches. In 1139, Demetrius raided the city of Ganja in Arran. He brought the iron gate of the defeated city to Georgia and donated it to Gelati Monastery at Kutaisi. Despite this brilliant victory, Demetrius could hold Ganja only for a few years. In reply to this, the sultan of Eldiguzids attacked Ganja several times, and in 1143 the town again jell to the sultan. According to Mkhitar Gosh, Demetrius ultimately gained possession of Ganja, but, when he gave his daughter in marriage to the sultan, he presented the latter with the town as dowry, and the sultain appointed his own emir to rule it.\n",

Eventual winner Alberto Contador first took the lead of the race after the second mountain stage, to Marmolada, by finishing nearly fifteen minutes ahead of previous race leader Gabriele Bosisio\u00a0\u2013 who had just gained the lead the stage before. In the race's final week, Contador faced stern challenges from Ricc\u00f2 and defending Giro champion Danilo Di Luca; however, their efforts bore no fruits as Contador went on to win the race. Russian Denis Menchov won the 2009 centennial edition of the Giro, after having taken the lead in a long time trial in stage 12, and defended it vigorously against attacks from his closest challenger, Danilo Di Luca, during the mountain stages of the final week. Di Luca came in second, 41\u00a0seconds behind the winner, and won the points classification. Subsequent to the Giro, both he and third-place finisher Franco Pellizotti became embroiled in doping scandals, were given bans, and had their results stripped.\n",

In June 1949, the 15th Guards IAD and the regiment were transferred to the Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO), becoming part of the 20th Fighter Air Defence Army at Oryol. There, the regiment became one of the first equipped with the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9, the first of a series of Mikoyan-and-Gurevich jet fighters. In April 1950, the regiment received its first Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s. In October 1950, the 180th Guards IAP was relocated to Tangshan in the People's Republic of China, where it was transferred to the newly formed 20th Fighter Aviation Division PVO. The regiment was stationed there until February 1952, training PLAAF pilots on the now-obsolete MiG-9s and providing air defence for Beijing.\n",

At the 1997 Indianapolis 500 while competing for the Cheever Racing team, Ward qualified on the third row and led the race for 49 laps before finishing the race in third place. His performance earned him the 1997 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award. He improved to a 6th-place finish in the 1998 Indy Racing League season while competing for the ISM Racing team. Ward was contracted to drive for the Pagan Racing team during the 1999 Indy Racing League season and, began the year with a third place at the season opening round at the Walt Disney World Speedway and a second place in Phoenix. He followed this with an impressive second place at the 1999 Indianapolis 500. Ward suffered inconsistent results for the remainder of the 1999 season to finish 11th in the championship. He won the 2002 race at Texas Motor Speedway for the Chip Ganassi Racing team, marking his first and only Indy Car victory.

His two gold stars for defeating yokozuna were both earned against Futahaguro (who, as Koji Kitao, also turned to professional wrestling). Takanofuji had the advantage of belonging to a stable that included two yokozuna, Chiyonofuji and Hokutoumi, which under sumo regulations meant he never had to face them in tournament play. However, his height of meant he had a higher centre of gravity than was ideal for a sumo wrestler, and he seemed to struggle when promoted above the mid maegashira ranks. Though he managed to reach the fourth highest komusubi ranking in July 1990 he could not maintain the rank, winning only two bouts there. He was demoted from the top division after the September 1991 tournament and announced his retirement in May 1992. His career coincided exactly with that of his stablemate Hokutoumi, who made his debut alongside him in March 1979 and also retired in May 1992. At Takanofuji's own request, it was the previous head of Kokonoe stable, ex-yokozuna Kitanofuji, his long time coach, and not his successor, ex-yokozuna Chiyonofuji, who performed the topknot cutting at Takanofuji's official retirement ceremony or danpatsu-shiki.\n",

These are commonly seen as the predecessor of the modern high-heeled shoe, while the poor and lower classes in Europe, as well as slaves in the New World, were barefoot. In the 15th century, the Crakow was fashionable in Europe. This style of shoe is named because it is thought to have originated in Krak\u00f3w, the capital of Poland. The style is characterized by the point of the shoe, known as the \"polaine\", which often was supported by a whalebone tied to the knee to prevent the point getting in the way while walking. Also during the 15th century, chopines were created in Turkey, and were usually 7\u20138\u00a0inches (17.7\u201320.3\u00a0cm) high. These shoes became popular in Venice and throughout Europe, as a status symbol revealing wealth and social standing. During the 16th century, royalty, such as Catherine de Medici or Mary I of England, started wearing high-heeled shoes to make them look taller or larger than life. By 1580, even men wore them, and a person with authority or wealth was often referred to as, \"well-heeled\".\n",

He spent Hilary term of 1929 in Oxford studying theology at Mansfield College, Oxford, when he became friends with the historian A. L. Rowse, and returned to the UK in 1931 on a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Balliol College, Oxford where he became a close friend of David Astor and an acquaintance of the eminent philosopher R. G. Collingwood. Rowse, who was gay, developed an intense infatuation with the heterosexual Trott, calling him one of the most beautiful, intelligent and charming men he had ever met. In his 1961 book All Souls and Appeasement, published when homosexuality was still illegal in Britain, Rowse wrote about Trott's \"beautiful head\" with an \"immensely lofty forehead, deep-violet eyes, nobility and sadness in the expression even when young, infinitely sensitive and understanding\", writing \"I had never met anything like it\". Rowse called his relationship with Trott an \"ideal platonic\" relationship, saying that Trott was a man he could never forget. Rowse, who was active in the Labour Party, claimed to have introduced Trott to socialism, noting that Trott had translated parts of Rowse's book Politics and the Younger Generation into German when they were published in Neu Bl\u00e4tter f\u00fcr den Sozialismus. Following his studies at Oxford, Trott spent six months in the United States.\n",

    "text": "Sailana State was founded by Raja Jai Singh, great-grandson of Maharaja Ratan Singh, founder of Ratlam State. In 1716 Jai singh took revenge against his uncle for the murder of his father, he killed him in a pitched battle at sagode and secured Ratlam for his elder brother. The two brothers then divided the state between themselves. Jai singh's capital was initially at Raoti. He built Sailana town as his new capital in 1736. He fought 22 battles in his lifetime, turning Sailana into an independent state. During Raja Mokham Singh's rule, Sailana suffered in war against the Scindias of Gwalior, most of the states eastern and southern lands were annexed. Raja Lakshman Singh of Sailana tried to push the Scindia's out of his kingdom, in 1818 he refused to pay chauth which was regularly levied, the Scindias retaliated by sending an army under Bujang Rao, the Gwalior army which had european arms and was French trained lost its advantage on the hills en route to Sailana and was defeated by Lakshman Singh, the captured soldiers were allowed to leave but all of their guns and artillery were taken. In 1819, Bapu Rao was appointed to punish the raja of Sailana and enforce tribute opon him. Bapu Rao had previously been sent by the Scindia's to defeat and exact tributes from the Maharaja of Jaipur and the Maharana of Udaipur. However on 5 January 1819, John Malcolm mediated between Gwalior and Sailana upon which Raja Lakshman Singh accepted British protection and agreed to pay a fixed tribute of \u00a34,200 to Gwalior (until 1860), in return for Scindia agreeing to refrain from any interference in Sailana. During British rule Sailana saw development under the capable rule of Raja Jaswant Singh and then under his son Raja Dilip Singh, many reforms were introduced over the coming years, with particular attention being paid to education and the provision of vernacular educational facilities. By 1947, education and medical aid were provided free of charge, the local municipality was placed on a democratic footing and the judiciary and executive made independent of each other. Although the economy was primarily agricultural, some limited industrialisation included oil mills, and iron and steel works. On 15 June 1948, Raja Dilip Singh signed the accession to the Indian Union.\n",

    "text": "Gower and his family removed to Nova Scotia House at Ipswich in 1817. There he devoted himself to the invention, patenting, design and building of a remarkable series of novel vessels including three vessels named Transit, a fly boat, two yachts the Unique and the Gower, the Landguard Fort Lifeboat, and a number of other inventions. He entered, but did not win, a competition for a novel form of lock for the Regents Canal. He suggested that, to protect coastal traffic, cruisers be stationed along the coast in communication with signal stations to provide a concerted defence system. He proposed a form of vertical-vaned windmill; an eye shade; various ship's logs and a \"double-barrelled\" capstan to do two jobs at once. He suggested a non-elastic substitute for imported hempen standing rigging to be made of wooden cylinders joined together by iron straps. He devised a method of keeping ships at proper distances by using the mast as a base line. He invented a mode of dropping a guess warp anchor with such accuracy that its end could be easily found and lifted. He devised a novel method of fidding a topgallant mast and several contrivances for the \"better nipping and stopping a cable\". He designed a long catamaran for forming a life raft and a form of floating sea anchor, or drogue anchor (he called it a \"propeller\") like an umbrella. He created a set of signals, that could be seen from all angles, using shapes instead of flags. He also suggested using a floating compass needle to find North. He experimented with various designs of paddle wheel on the River Lee Canal that anticipated the design of the wheels used by steam paddlers many years later. He invented and built the Landguard Fort Lifeboat, which carried up to 25 people and was virtually unsinkable. He proposed fitting canal barges with 'spud wheels' that could propel the vessel by catching on the canal bottom. He saw that a combination of paddle wheels and spud wheels could take vessels over mud flats at various conditions of the tide. Gower also constructed a twin hulled catamaran, just ten feet long, on which he mounted a barrel of water that drained to underwater by a curved pipe pointing aft. His twin floats achieved two miles per hour apparently without the need for power from sail or steam. He thus demonstrated water jet propulsion. He anticipated that a steam water pump, so contrived, could propel vessels without the need for paddles. He gives credit to Dr Franklin (probably Benjamin Franklin) and a Mr Rumsay of Philadelphia for this idea and hoped that his little experiment would encourage others to pursue the notion.\n",

    "text": "The current 12 car started out in 1994 at Michigan as the No. 07 Ford driven by Robby Gordon and owned by German-American businessman and former Ford executive Michael Kranefuss along with Newman/Haas Racing co-principal Carl Haas. The car started and finished 38th after Gordon crashed on lap 70. After another start with Geoff Brabham at the Brickyard 400, the team\u2014 known as Kranefuss-Haas Racing\u2014 went full-time in 1995 with John Andretti driving the Kmart/Little Caesars-sponsored No. 37 Ford. Andretti won the pole at the Mountain Dew Southern 500 and finished 18th in the points. The team struggled in 1996 and Kranefuss decided to replace Andretti with Jeremy Mayfield in what amounted to a driver swap between Kranefuss-Haas and Cale Yarborough's team as Andretti replaced Mayfield in Yarborough's No. 98. The team picked up co-sponsorship from Royal Crown Cola for the following season and improved to be 13th in the points in 1997, but it was obvious the team wouldn't succeed if it only fielded one team. At the end of the season Kranefuss and Haas dissolved the partnership and the Kmart sponsorship moved over to Travis Carter's team, which became Haas-Carter Motorsports and the Little Caesars sponsorship left the team.\n",

    "text": "Something for the Rest of Us is the ninth studio album by American rock band Goo Goo Dolls. It was released on August 28, 2010 in Australia and on August 31 in North America through Warner Bros. Records. The recording process took place during the spring to fall of 2009 in the GCR Audio studio in Buffalo and Paramount Studios as well as \"the Ark\" in Los Angeles, with producer Tim Palmer. A single had been originally slated to be released in November 2009 with an album release in February 2010, but the band went back into the studio in January 2010. According to lead singer and guitarist John Rzeznik, this was done to make further improvements on what they had previously thought had been a finished record. Several producers were brought in to assist on the production process, including Butch Vig, John Fields, Paul David Hager and Rob Cavallo. Something for the Rest of Us is the third Goo Goo Dolls studio album that Cavallo has produced (Dizzy Up the Girl and Gutterflower). When asked about the length of time between albums, Rzeznik admitted it was a mix of songwriting issues as well as taking time out for personal reasons; \"I wanted to really dig deep and there are a million songs I threw away, like, \u201cNah, it's not good enough. I wanna do something different. I wanna do something better, go deeper. I also wanted to have a life with my girlfriend for a while. I owed it to her to spend some time with her and be normal and be in one place. That was kind of important.\" In one of the Ustream sessions, Robby revealed that the album would have twelve songs and \"Real\" is not among them. In late May, John announced that \"Home\" would be the first single and was released onto radio and iTunes stores on June 8, 2010.\n",

New York Press critic Armond White called the film \"a genuine pop classic\", and praised Hardwicke for turning \"Meyer's book series into a Bront\u00eb-esque vision.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \"I saw it at a sneak preview. Last time I saw a movie in that same theater, the audience welcomed it as an opportunity to catch up on gossip, texting, and laughing at private jokes. This time the audience was rapt with attention\". In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, \"Twilight is unabashedly a romance. All the story's inherent silliness aside, it is intent on conveying the magic of meeting that one special person you've been waiting for. Maybe it is possible to be 13 and female for a few hours after all\". USA Today gave the film two out of four stars and Claudia Puig wrote, \"Meyer is said to have been involved in the production of Twilight, but her novel was substantially more absorbing than the unintentionally funny and quickly forgettable film\". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"B\" rating and Owen Gleiberman praised Hardwicke's direction: \"She has reconjured Meyer's novel as a cloudburst mood piece filled with stormy skies, rippling hormones, and understated visual effects\".\n",

    "text": "Although April Wine officially began in late 1969 in Waverley, Nova Scotia, their roots can be traced back to St. John's Newfoundland in 1967/68. David and Ritchie Henman moved there when their father took a job at a local furrier company, Mitchell Furs. They would be heard jamming in a house on the corner of Bonaventure Avenue and Fleming Street in St. John's before relocating to Nova Scotia. The original members were brothers David Henman on guitar and Ritchie Henman on drums. Their cousin Jim Henman joined in on bass and Myles Goodwyn completed the sound on lead vocals and guitar. The band quickly realized that Halifax did not provide immediate opportunities to play and record, the band sent a demo tape to Aquarius Records, company managers Terry Flood and Donald K. Tarlton returned a rejection letter but the members mistook it for an invitation. On April 1, 1970, April Wine went down the road to Quebec, the band brought their instruments and 100$ in cash. Despite the misunderstanding, Flood and Tarlton signed the band to their record label and set the band up in a chalet and allowed them to play at a local comedy club. They recorded and released their self-titled debut album April Wine in September 1971 which had a single named Fast Train which was a top 40 hit in Canada and peaked at #38 on the RPM Singles Chart . However, the album was a flop with low sales, the single established Miles Goodwyn as the main songwriter for the band and the success of the single led the band's label to ask for a second album amid the first of many lineup changes: Jim Henman left the band in the fall of 1971 and was replaced by Jim Clench.\n",

The geographical range of the tiger in the Russian Far East stretches south to north for almost the length of Primorsky Krai and into southern Khabarovsk Krai east and south of the Amur River. It also occurs within the Greater Xing'an Range, which crosses into Russia from China at several places in southwest Primorye. In both regions, peaks are generally above sea level, with only a few reaching or more. This region represents a merger zone of two bioregions: the East Asian coniferous-deciduous complex and the Taiga, resulting in a mosaic of forest types that vary with elevation, topography, and history. Key habitats of the Siberian tiger are Korean pine broadleaf forests with a complex composition and structure.\n",

The fall of the Georgian republic to the Bolshevik invasion in 1921 precluded his return to the homeland. He lectured at the University of Hamburg and, after the end of World War II, moved to Z\u00fcrich, where he taught the Georgian and Russian languages.

The vast woodlands north of Deidesheim, also known as Vorst or Forst (cognate with English forest and meaning the same) was excluded from this arrangement and was reserved as the Prince-Bishop's hunting ground. In this forest lie the village's beginnings, and of course its namesake.

When the French Revolution spread to the German lands on the Rhine\u2019s left bank, Forst, too, temporarily became part of France\u2019s territory. In 1816, what had once been Electoral Palatinate territory on the left bank was named the Rheinkreis, and later Rheinpfalz, and annexed to the Kingdom of Bavaria; the Palatinate remained Bavarian until the end of the Second World War.\n",

The name Cavaillie was possibly inherited from his grandmother Margaret Cavaillie, wife of James Mercer overseer at Fort George. Margaret Cavaillie (1699, St Andrews \u2013 1777, St Andrews) was the daughter of captain James Cavaillie, who it is said came to Britain in the army of William of Orange and settled in Fife as a wine merchant and died at Cupar Fife in 1716. He went to the Military Academy at Woolwich and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Regiment of Artillery in 1799 at the age of 16. He served in Ireland in the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. He was promoted to second captain (a rank unique to the Ordnance) in 1806. Promotion in the Royal Artillery was very slow, especially in peacetime, as it relied solely on seniority. Unlike in the rest of the British Army of the time there was no opportunity for purchase of commissions in the Ordnance. Mercer was not breveted as a major until 1 March 1824, though this was then backdated to 12 August 1819.\n",

In 1930 as Negus he invited a Belgian military mission to train and modernize the Ethiopian military, which included the Kebur Zabagna. The unit was organized in three battalions of trained regular infantry armed with rifles, machineguns and mortars; one battalion consisted of men from the earlier mahal safari. The Kebur Zabagna also had one heavy machine-gun company. It was commanded by Ethiopian graduates of Saint Cyr, the French military academy, at the time of the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. As a unit, the Imperial Bodyguard only participated in the Battle of Maychew (31 March 1936), where they inflicted heavy losses on the 2nd Eritrean Division until the Ethiopian troops were forced to withdraw; the Imperial Guard thereafter served in the rearguard. Afterwards many of its members joined the various groups of the Ethiopian resistance.\n",

The popularity of Flashdance led to his (co-)writing songs featured on the soundtracks of Ghostbusters, Beverly Hills Cop, The NeverEnding Story and The Breakfast Club.

At age 20, he became a cattle drover in Nevada. He arrived in Tonopah in 1902 and dealt cards at the Tonopah Club. He moved to Winnemucca, where he became friends with United States Senator George S. Nixon. By the age of 30, he made a fortune in Nevada, having mined in Tonopah and Goldfield. With Nixon as his partner, Wingfield was worth $30 million after taking their Goldfield Consolidated Mining Company public in 1906, which had been organized with $50 million in capital. In 1906, his wife, May, filed for divorce; the case ended in an annulment. In 1908, he moved to Reno and became active in politics, banking, ranching, and hotel-keeping. He owned many of the banks in Nevada, as well as several hotels in Reno, including the Riverside Hotel, and an international mining company. He also ran a ranch and dairy farm in Fallon. In 1928, Wingfield was elected to the University Board of Regents for the University of Nevada, but rejected an offer to become a US Senator. Much of Wingfield's fortune was lost during the Great Depression.\n",

All five tracks were produced by Stuart Stuart at Analog Heart Studios, and co-written by Amy, George & Bovino. Kat Hunter of The AU Review felt that the EP \"serves up a delicious helping of pop goodness filled with danceable melodies, catchy sing-along lyrics in addition to light and perfectly whipped harmonies and group vocals\". The group played at the Sonic Bang Festival in Bangkok on 24 August 2013, sharing the roster with Placebo, Pitbull, Far East Movement, Jason Mraz, and Owl City. The band appeared at Sullivan Hall in New York City on 18 October for the 2013 CMJ Music Marathon. On 1 December 2013, they performed and presented an award at that year's ARIA Music Awards. By that time, the band had enlisted Dean Gordon to replace Tredly on drums.\n",

Her father was a former U.S. Senator from Montana and businessman involved in mining and railroads, who had largely amassed a fortune in copper mining operations in Butte, Montana and Jerome, Arizona. He was also a railroad magnate and one of the founders of Las Vegas. Her mother, the daughter of French-Canadian immigrants, was born and raised in Michigan, and was an aspiring singer and musician who met William while she was living in a boarding house in Butte. Clark was raised Roman Catholic, the faith of her mother, while her father was a Protestant.\n",

    "text": "The company's forebears came from a family in Rudolstadt, Thuringia that built harpsichords. The family was subsequently based in Neustadt an der Orla, where it took up instrument building. Eduard Steingraeber was born in 1823; he first apprenticed with his uncle, Gottlieb Steingraeber, in Neustadt an der Orla. During his years of travel, he worked in a number of places, including the workshop of the Viennese piano builder Nannette Streicher, daughter of the well-known Augsburg piano maker, Andreas Stein. While there, he was permitted to accompany Franz Liszt on his concert tours, where he looked after the pianos and grand pianos that Liszt \"demolished\" at his performances. In 1852, Eduard Steingraeber founded the Pianofortefabrik Steingraeber [Steingraeber Piano Factory] in Bayreuth. Steingraeber purchased the Liebhardt Palace on Friedrichstra\u00dfe in 1871 and made it the head office of the company. And it has borne the name of Steingraeber Haus ever since. The company rapidly became the largest piano factory in Bavaria. Steingraeber has also supplied pianos to the Wagner family and to the Bayreuther Festspiele since the festival began in 1876. In 1881, Richard Wagner commissioned the instrument known as the Parsifal bell, which is used in the temple scenes of Wagner's opera, Parsifal. During high volume production periods, Steingraeber's more than thirty employees, including twelve piano builders, specialise in the manufacture of high-quality pianos that are still predominantly handcrafted. The cases are constructed of solid wood and no particle board is ever used. Steingraeber & S\u00f6hne even treats the surfaces of the piano case with shellac and wax instead of polyester and synthetic resin varnishes. The company has sought technical solutions to simplify piano playing for wheelchair users and, above all, to provide them with a serviceable alternative to working the pedals with their feet. Steingraeber currently produces some forty uprights and seventy grand pianos per year. Since the company was founded, however, Steingraeber & S\u00f6hne has built over 40,000 grand and upright pianos.\n",

The line over the pass from Logan to Garrison, Montana via Butte became the Rocky Mountain Division, Second and Fourth Subdivisions, built in 1889. This was Northern Pacific's scenic transcontinental passenger train route used by the famous North Coast Limited and its Amtrak successor, the North Coast Hiawatha, which was discontinued in 1979. The line over the pass is currently owned by BNSF Railway. It has been inactive since 1983, as its grades and curvature are poorly suited to freight trains, which (now operated by Montana Rail Link) utilize the former Northern Pacific's easier route via Helena. It is unlikely that the rail line over the pass will ever be used again, but BNSF has resisted tearing out the line because the original lease with the Northern Pacific and the US Forest Service requires that the grade be returned to its original status, a very costly process.\n",

    "text": "Blyth was born 22 March 1948 in Chessington; his father was an architect and his mother a teacher and painter. He was schooled from an early age in Epsom, Surrey, England. He began studying the piano at the age of four years, and in his teens worked to gain a scholarship to Trinity College of Music in London. There, he learned the play the organ, then transferred to the University of Bristol in 1966 to study electronic engineering, a decision made easier because he was \"hopelessly infatuated with an astonishingly pretty girl from my social group at home who'd gone up the year before.\" At Bristol, Blyth founded the Student Music Society, and studied orchestra conducting; as a senior he conducted a performance of Bach's complex masterpiece St Matthew Passion. After college, he obtained a position with the Compton Organ Company in their research department where he met Bill Kelsey, his early mentor, who showed him how to lay out circuits on printed circuit boards. Compton was \"on its last legs\", according to Blyth, and he left to join Graseby Instruments where he designed electronic filters for underwater weapons to satisfy Admiralty contracts. Blyth spent evenings at Kelsey's Notting Hill flat helping him assemble a large mixing desk, one used by Emerson, Lake & Palmer at the \"legendary\" Isle of Wight Festival 1970. With this success, Kelsey left Compton to form with a business partner the professional audio equipment company Kelsey & Morris.\n",

After his first historical painting, \"The Interview between Milton and Galileo,\" was hung in 1840\" at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, Mr. Lucy divided his time between England and France. He lived in Barbizon for 16 years, but rather than joining the landscape painters there, he chose to continue is focus on significant scenes in British history. In 1847, he painted \u201cEmbarkation of the Pilgrim Fathers in the Mayflower,\" (later retitled: \"Departure of the Pilgrims from Delft Haven\"), which won him a prize bestowed by Prince Albert at the prestigious Westminster Hall competition in London in the same year. It was also one of the first pieces to bring Mr. Lucy attention on the east side of the English Channel. It would not be long before, \"he was a regular contributor to the fresco competitions for the New Palace of Westminster.\" In 1848, it too was exhibited it at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Family records show that in 1838 Mr. Lucy \"receiv[ed] considerable distinction and much practice as a rising artist [after he] obtained the Two Hundred Guineas Prize at the Exhibition of Cartoons in Westminster Hall, for his painting of The Pilgrim Fathers Embarking for America, which [resulted] in the late Sir Robert Peel taking great notice of him.\" Of all his work, Mr. Lucy is best known for his 1848 painting, The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers A.D. 1620, which is currently displayed in the National Heritage Museum in Lexington, Massachusetts, in the United States of America. Thereafter, Mr. Lucy served as the elected chairman of the committee of the New British Institution since its foundation in 1869 and \"for many years was instructor at a drawing and design school in Camden Town, which he founded along with Thomas Seddon, Cave Thomas and one or two others. Unfortunately, \"owing to want of funds, not withstanding the good services it was doing, [the school] was subsequently handed over to the government.\"\n",

    "text": "After appearing uncredited in over a dozen movies Hudson got his break in 1951's Hard, Fast and Beautiful. He appeared in a few other movies and TV shows before being cast as Special Agent Mike Andrews in I Led Three Lives. In 1954, while also still doing I Led Three Lives, Hudson was cast in the television serial Rocky Jones, Space Ranger as Ranger Clark. After his stint as Clark on Rocky Jones Hudsons parts started to be more in the genres of Science fiction, Fantasy, and Monster movies, especially the latter with starring roles in such films as The She Creature, The Amazing Colossal Man and, perhaps most famously, as the husband in 1958's cult classic Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. In 1964 he was cast as the doomed first Captain of the Seaview, John Phillips, in the pilot episode of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. In 1965 he was back on Voyage as a different character in an episode infamous among fans of the series due to its heavy use of archive footage from the pilot episode (specifically a scene with Hudson and Richard Basehart leaving the Nelson Institute, being chased and attacked by a helicopter and which ended with the death of Hudson's character and the car going off a cliff aflame) giving him the dubious honour of being the only person \"killed\" on that show twice. In 1966 he was cast as a reporter in the second part of the first Television appearance of Mr. Freeze in a first-season episode of Batman titled \"Rats Like Cheese\". From then on he had several small parts in various movies and TV shows, his last part being Mr. Dunn in 1971's How's Your Love Life?.\n",

One third of the original strength was transferred from the 72nd Infantry Division and one third from the 79th Infantry Division. This meant that part of the divisional strength originated from around Koblenz in the Rhineland, and part from around Linz in Austria. It was a Category 14 division, which were established with the usual three infantry regiments, but with only 12 companies per regiment instead of the usual 14. It included an artillery regiment, but had a reduced complement of equipment in all areas, and its soldiers were between 27 and 32 years of age. Its commander from formation was Generalmajor (Brigadier) Rudolf Wagner. Following its formation it was first deployed as part of the occupation forces in France between June and September 1941. On 2 July 1941, Wagner was replaced by Generalleutnant (Major General) Dr. Walter Hinghofer, an Austrian-born career officer who had served the whole of World War I fighting the Russians on the Eastern Front. On 14 September 1941, the division was ordered to deploy to Belgrade in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia where it was to come under the command of LXV Corps. This was the result of repeated requests for reinforcements from the Wehrmacht Commander Southeast, Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm List due to a growing insurgency in the eastern parts of the partitioned Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n",

    "text": "Cox contributed the non-album song \"Things Just Ain't The Same\" to the soundtrack to the 1997 film Money Talks. A dance remix of the song, produced by Hex Hector, became her second number-one hit on Billboards Dance Club Songs chart and was included on her second album, 1998's One Wish. As with her self-titled debut album, her sophomore effort was once again executive-produced by Davis, but featured more uptempo, contemporary R&B, and a slew of new producers and personnel to incorporate dance and club music, including Montell Jordan, Anthony \"Shep\" Crawford, Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, and DJ Quik. One Wish peaked at number 72 on the Billboard 200 and earned a platinum certification from the RIAA, while reaching gold status in Canada. The album capitalized on the crossover success of lead single \"Nobody's Supposed to Be Here\" which became Cox's most successful entry on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two, and remaining there for eight consecutive weeks, making it one of the longest stays at number two in chart history. The song also reached number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, spending a then record-breaking 14 weeks at number one, while third single \"We Can't Be Friends,\" a duet with R. L. Huggar, reached the top ten, with \"It's Over Now\" and \"I Never Knew\" become chart toppers on the Dance Club Songs chart.\n",

He played his junior football for the Kybybolite Football Club and then the Glenelg Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), including seven games in the league side before returning to the Under-18 team for the Grand Final. Despite Glenelg losing to Port Adelaide, he gathered 40 possessions and was awarded the Alan Stewart Medal as the best player in the game.

The trainset was the second internal combustion powered streamliner built for mainline service in the United States, the first such train powered by a diesel engine, and the first to enter revenue service. The trainset consists of one power/RPO car, one baggage/buffet/coach car, and one coach/observation car. The cars are made of stainless steel, permanently articulated together with Jacobs bogies. The construction incorporated recent advances such as shotwelding (a specialized type of spot welding) to join the stainless steel, and unibody construction and articulation to reduce weight. It was the first of nine similarly built trainsets made for Burlington and its technologies were pivotal in the subsequent dieselization of passenger rail service. Its operating economy, speed, and public appeal demonstrated the potential for diesel-electric powered trains to revitalize and restore profitability to passenger rail service that had suffered a catastrophic loss of business with the Great Depression. Originally named the Burlington Zephyr during its demonstration period, it became the Pioneer Zephyr as Burlington expanded its fleet of Zephyr trainsets.\n",

In 1959, she accepted the lead role in Douglas Sirk's remake of Imitation of Life, a drama for Universal Pictures in which she portrayed a struggling stage actress, which proved to be another box-office hit. Turner's final starring role was in 1966's Madame X, for which she earned a David di Donatello award for Best Actress. She spent the majority of the 1970s in semiretirement, appearing in touring stage plays, such as Forty Carats and Bell, Book and Candle. In 1982, she was cast in a recurring guest role on the television soap opera Falcon Crest, in which she appeared in several episodes. She made her final film appearance in the comedy horror film Witches' Brew in 1980.\n",

As part of terms of the Treaty of Paris peace settlement, France gave up its claim to Canada and negotiated to keep the small but rich sugar island of Guadeloupe instead. By Britain's Royal Proclamation of 1763, Canada (part of New France) was renamed the Province of Quebec. The new British province extended from the coast of Labrador on the Atlantic Ocean, southwest through the Saint Lawrence River Valley to the Great Lakes and beyond to the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Portions of its southwest (below the Great Lakes) were later ceded to the United States in the Treaty of Paris (1783) at the conclusion of the American Revolution although the British maintained a military presence there until 1796. In 1791, the territory north of the Great Lakes was divided into Lower Canada and Upper Canada.\n",

Three-time co-winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans and 2011 Formula Nippon champion Andr\u00e9 Lotterer drove in lieu of Kamui Kobayashi at Caterham. At 32 years and 288 days old, Lotterer was the oldest driver to debut in Formula One since Giovanni Lavaggi at the 1995 German Grand Prix and it was his first time in a Formula One car since he was a test driver for Jaguar in the 2002 season. Marussia announced that GP2 Series competitor and test and reserve driver Alexander Rossi would be entered in place of regular driver Max Chilton, because of reported \"contractual issues\" but the organisation who represented Chilton said that he relinquished his role \"voluntarily\". Chilton's seat was subsequently reinstated following a successful request to the stewards by Marussia, meaning Rossi drove only in the first practice session. In that session, Sauber reserve driver Giedo van der Garde utilised Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez's car.\n",

Pembroke Lakes Mall is one of a very few malls in the Miami area that has opened without a Jordan Marsh store because their Florida stores were disbanded a year before the mall was built. Prior to Pembroke Lakes Mall, Waldrep Dairy Farm owned the land and operated a dairy farm there as JCPenney and Burdines had moved in from the Hollywood Fashion Center six miles east while Sears moved from the Hollywood Mall. In 1995, the fifth anchor pad was filled by Dillard's while stores also opened at Brandon Town Center and Seminole Towne Center at this time. The mall gained a second Dillard's in 1997 as Mervyns sold its south Florida stores to the Little Rock retailer. Burdines merged with Macy's in 2003 and then simply Macy's in 2005. Macy's would also fill the sixth anchor pad as a second location. Like all Macy's in Florida that used to be Burdines, the palm tree columns reminiscent the Burdines style of all architecture that remains today. In 2016, GGP announced that the mall's Sears would shrink to make room for an AMC movie theater, which opened in 2017.\n",

In 1920, he instituted Columbia College's General Honors Course, a two-year undergraduate seminar that would later help inspire \"Masterworks of Western Literature,\" now known commonly as \"Literature Humanities,\" the second component of Columbia College's Core Curriculum. This course taught the classics in translation instead of the original Latin or Greek, a concept he elaborated in his noted essay The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent. He found little support for the course from the senior faculty, and junior faculty members like Mark Van Doren and later after 1923, Mortimer Adler took up sections of the course. This course would later go on to inspire the Great Books movement, centered on the Great Books of the Western World. The course was discontinued in 1928, though later reconstituted. In 1929, Adler left Columbia to join University of Chicago, where he continued to work on the theme with Robert Hutchins, President of the University.

The clan, originally known as the Kakizaki clan (\u8823\u5d0e\u6c0f), had settled in Kakizaki, Kawauchi, Mutsu on the Shimokita Peninsula. Claiming descent from the Takeda clan of Wakasa Province, the family later took the name Matsumae. In exchange for their service in defending the country, the Matsumae were made exempt from owing rice to the shogunate in tribute, and from the sankin-k\u014dtai system, under which most daimy\u014ds (feudal lords of Edo period Japan) were required to spend half the year at Edo, while their families spent the entire year at Edo and were, essentially, held hostage to prevent rebellion.\n",

    "text": "On August 4, a significant 100 million people were affected by a massive blackout that spread across the Indonesian provinces/regions of Banten, Jakarta, West Java, parts of Central Java, and also Yogyakarta. The blackout began as early as 11:50 local time, when Jakarta MRT authorities began to detect the loss of electrical supply, rendering its trains inoperable and requiring people stuck inside to evacuate from it. Jakarta LRT and KRL Commuterline also suffered from the blackout making TransJakarta the only mass transit transportation remaining in operation at the time of the blackout. Ride-hailing services like Gojek and Grab receive major problems due to lack of internet services. The governor of Jakarta, Anies Baswedan made Transjakarta and Jakarta MRT services free of charge until the day ends. Most of the traffic lights stopped functioning, causing traffic congestions. The initial blackout lasts around 9 hours where at 21:00 local time power to most of the affected areas has been restored, although power to some rural and residential areas in Jakarta has not been restored yet past midnight. Some areas initially had its electricity back up by midnight or later, only to have its electricity cut off again, causing almost 20 hours of blackout in total. Initially, the PLN (Indonesia's state electricity company) stated that cause of the outage was due to disruptions in a number of plants in Java, but later said that the cause was due to a disruption in the Ungaran-Pemalang high-voltage power line.\n",

The route follows Highway 37 to State Highway 135, continuing eastward along the latter through Biwabik and then to Aurora, where it leaves Highway 135 and follows St. Louis County Road 100 to the center of town. From there it turns south until the city border, and then resumes its eastward travel along County Road 110 to Hoyt Lakes. From Hoyt Lakes the road gradually arcs southward. This portion is also called Skibo Lookout Road, after the Skibo Vista Scenic Overlook, which overlooks the Laurentian Divide. County Road 110 ends at its junction with County Road 16 (Town Line Road), and the byway route again continues east, through the unincorporated towns of Fairbanks and Basset. Crossing the St. Louis-Lake county line, the roadway becomes Lake County Road 15 and passes through Toimi. This is the longest portion of the route, traveling 23 miles to Lax Lake Road, where it turns south along County Road 4 for approximately 2 miles. It then travels east along County Road 5 into Silver Bay, ending at Highway 61 near the North Shore.\n",

He eventually made his first team debut in a match away to Barnsley at the start of the 1968-69 season, but played irregularly for the first team, amassing only 44 Football League appearances in four seasons. His only goal for the \"Gills\" came against Brighton & Hove Albion in September 1969. Nonetheless, his ability to operate in many different positions on the field of play was considered important to the squad. In August 1971 he was released from his contract at Priestfield Stadium and joined Northampton Town of the Fourth Division. After just one season with the club, however, he dropped back into non-league football with Telford United. He rejoined Bedford Town in October 1972 and played for the club for eight years. His later clubs included Hitchin Town and Buckingham Town. In 1985, he joined Kempston Rovers, where he remained well into the 1990s, going on to serve as the club's assistant manager and manager, holding the latter position between 1986 and 1990.\n",

His best bowling figures were 7/64, which came in 1992, his best with the ball. During the 1992 season, he took 74 wickets at an average of 21.74, with those best figures coming against Durham at Eastwood Gardens. Up to this time, he had also developed into a handy lower order batsman for the county. In his 125 matches, he scored 1,795 runs at a batting average of 15.74, with 4 half centuries and a high score of 67 which came against Hampshire in the 1989 County Championship. Davis also made his debut in List-A cricket for Kent against Worcestershire. A tidy bowler with a good economy rate, Davis played 106 List-A matches for the county, during which time he took 103 wickets an average of 31.71, which included his only List-A five wicket haul of 5/52 against Somerset.

He rose to prominence as the head coach of the New York Giants, whom he led to two Super Bowl titles. Parcells later served as the head coach of the New England Patriots, New York Jets, and Dallas Cowboys. Throughout his career, he coached teams that were in a period of decline and turned them into postseason contenders. He is the only coach in NFL history to lead four teams to the playoffs and three teams to a conference championship game.\n\nWhen Parcells became the head coach of the Giants in 1983, he took over a franchise that had qualified for the postseason only once (1981) in the past decade and had only one winning record in their last 10 seasons. Parcells brought new success to the team and within four years, guided them to their first Super Bowl win. His tenure with the Giants spanned eight seasons and concluded with a second championship victory in Super Bowl XXV. After the Super Bowl win, Parcells retired as a coach in 1991.\n\nIn 1993, Parcells came out of retirement to become the head coach of the Patriots, another struggling franchise at the time. Once again, Parcells changed the fortunes for the team and led them to an appearance in Super Bowl XXXI during his fourth season as their coach, although the game ended in defeat for the Patriots. Amid conflicts with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, he left the franchise after their Super Bowl loss and became the head coach of the Jets for the next season. Under Parcells, the Jets went from having only one victory in the previous season to obtaining a winning record, and they reached the in his second year with the team.\n\nAfter three seasons as the Jets' head coach, Parcells retired for a second time in 1999, but came back to football in 2003 to become the head coach of the Cowboys. He coached the Cowboys for four seasons and helped them qualify for the playoffs twice, although the team was eliminated in the first round each time. Following the team's loss in a , Parcells retired from coaching for good in 2007.",

He began his minor league playing career with the Gulf Coast Yankees in , where he hit .316 (12-for-38) in 10 games.\n\nIn , he was promoted to the Tampa Yankees, the Single-A affiliate of the New York Yankees. In his first year of playing, he batted .280 with 13 home runs and 37 RBIs in 69 games.\n\nHe began with Tampa, and after hitting .333, he was promoted to the AA Norwich Navigators and hit seven home runs before he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds with fellow prospects Jackson Meli\u00e1n and Ed Yarnall for Denny Neagle. He finished the summer with the Reds' AA affiliate in Chattanooga, hitting .172 (11-for-64) with one home run and 9 RBIs in 16 games, before returning to football practice at Michigan.\n\nIn , he was traded back to the Yankees with Michael Coleman for Wily Mo Pena. However, he struggled at the AAA level Columbus Clippers. He hit .234 over three seasons as the Clippers starting third baseman. Frustrated by his lack of progress and in need of a third baseman at the major league level, the Yankees acquired Aaron Boone at the 2003 trading deadline.\n\nBoone eventually hit a pennant-clinching home run against the Boston Red Sox in the 2003 postseason, but then injured his knee in a pickup basketball game during the offseason. The injury would keep him out for the entire 2004 season.",

    "text": "Before 2004 season began, the Cowboys faced adversity and were forced to adjust. Coming off their first winning season in five years, the team, under Bill Parcells's direction, continued to bring in veteran talent and draft promising prospects. In the off-season, the Cowboys signed quarterback Vinny Testaverde and traded for disgruntled wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. Both Testaverde and Johnson had played for Parcells when he had coached the New York Jets, and both were eager to reunite with Parcells. Johnson was especially happy to be in Dallas, as he had been deactivated for the final six games of the previous season while with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for \"conduct detrimental to the team\". In return for Johnson, the Buccaneers received Joey Galloway. The draft saw the arrival of running back Julius Jones, cornerbacks Jacques Reeves and Nate Jones, and college quarterback turned wide receiver Patrick Crayton. In owner Jerry Jones's continuing quest to acquire quarterback talent, the Cowboys traded for the rights to Drew Henson, another baseball player attempting to return to football. Henson starred at Michigan, keeping future NFL quarterback Tom Brady from claiming the starting job outright. His struggles in the New York Yankees farm system led him to reconsider his career and opt for a return to football, similar to Chad Hutchinson, whom the team had acquired two years prior. Hutchinson was later released.\n",

Shortly after Specter opened a law practice in Atlantic City, New Jersey, incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Richard Schweiker unexpectedly announced his decision not to seek re-election to his seat. Specter, believing his reputation as a political moderate would help him in the general election, decided to run. In the Republican primary, Specter faced state senator Edward Howard, as well as Delaware County councilman Bud Haabestad, who was endorsed by Schweiker, then-governor Thornburgh and John Heinz. Specter ultimately defeated Haabestad, his most prominent challenger, by approximately 37,000 votes.\n",

At Quarto, he and Vaqueiras saved his brother-in-law Alberto of Malaspina when he was unhorsed. The first phase of the war ended with a truce in April 1193. By now, Boniface was Marquess of Montferrat, following the deaths of his father in 1191 and of Conrad, the newly elected King of Jerusalem, in 1192. (No claim to Montferrat ever seems to have been made on behalf of Conrad's posthumous daughter Maria.)\n",

The top vote-getter, State Senator Jay Dardenne of Baton Rouge, another Republican, polled 191,543 votes (29.8 percent) and was forced into a runoff election with Heitmeier. In third place was Republican former state party chairman Mike Francis, an energy industrialist from Crowley, who polled 168,118 (26.1 percent). None of the other four candidates, two of whom were Republicans, garnered more than 9 percent of the vote. Francis, a staunch conservative refused to support the more moderate Republican, Dardenne, in the pending runoff. However, Heitmeier withdrew from the race on the grounds that he lacked needed funding from national party sources. He also noted the decimation of the African-American voter base caused by Hurricane Katrina the previous year. Dardenne hence won by default.\n",

The band took home the MTV2 award as well. Yellowcard featured on an episode of MTV's Real World/Road Rules Challenge, performing \"Way Away\" while cast members trashed a mock hotel room in true rock star fashion. The album's first track, \"Way Away\", appeared on the soundtracks of SSX 3 and Madden NFL 2004. The album's second track, \"Breathing\", also appeared in EA's  and FlatOut 2. Following \"Ocean Avenue\"'s success, the band released the single \"Only One\", a rock ballad which also did fairly well on TRL and radio. The Ocean Avenue album sold over one million copies in the U.S. alone.\n",

In 1932 he joined the party on a probationary basis, which was partly self-imposed, and travelled to the Soviet Union as part of a delegation that also included Barbara Wootton. He also visited Isherwood and Spender in Berlin. He became a full member of the party in 1934. In 1936 he married Hilda Percival (1909\u20131995), a fellow teacher and CPGB member, with whom he had a son and a daughter (their son, Christopher Upward, became a linguist). During the Second World War the family was evacuated with Upward's school to Cleveleys in Lancashire, where Alleyn's temporarily merged with the nearby Rossall School. Starting in 1942 Upward and his wife began to be investigated by MI5 in relation to their communist activities. Upward remained committed to internationalism and socialism for the rest of his life, although he and Hilda left the CPGB in 1948, believing that it was no longer revolutionary and that its leadership was trying to appease the Labour government.\n",

    "text": "Guillou was born in Angers. Following his first studies in piano and organ, he became the organist at the church St. Serge in Angers at the age of 12. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire under Marcel Dupr\u00e9, Maurice Durufl\u00e9 and Olivier Messiaen. In 1952, while still studying, Guillou played the premiere of his organ transcription of The Musical Offering by Johann Sebastian Bach at Erskine and American United Church in Montreal, Canada. In 1955, he accepted a position as professor of organ and composition at the Institute of Sacred Music in Lisbon. During this time, he wrote his first compositions (Fantaisie op. 1, Colloque no. 1, and parts of Colloque no. 2). Due to health reasons, Guillou underwent long term medical treatment in Berlin and relocated to this city in 1958. During the following five years, he composed numerous works and made his first recordings at Lutherkirche and St. Matthias church. During this time, he met composer Max Baumann, who wrote his first organ compositions (Invocation op. 67 no. 5, Trois pi\u00e8ces br\u00e8ves op. 67 no. 6, Psalmi op. 67 no. 2) for Guillou, who premiered these works in a concert on January 20, 1963, at St. Matthias church in Berlin. In 1963 he returned to Paris, having been appointed Titular Organist at Saint-Eustache in succession to Andr\u00e9 Marchal. Appointed Organiste Titulaire Emerite at St. Eustache in September 2014, Guillou completed 52 years as organist at Saint-Eustache in March 2015, when he was succeeded by two co-titulaires. On April 22, 1966, Guillou gave his debut concert at the Berliner Philharmonie, where he played Max Reger's Phantasia and Fugue on BACH op. 46 at the occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of Reger's death. On October 6, 1966, Guillou played the world premiere of his organ work Pour le Tombeau de Colbert at the Berliner Philharmonie.\n",

He became interested in superheroes through the Adventures of Superman TV series. Although David's parents approved of his reading Harvey Comics and comics featuring Disney characters, they did not approve of superhero books, especially those published by Marvel Comics, feeling that characters that looked like monsters, such as the Thing or the Hulk, or who wore bug-eyed costumes, like Spider-Man, did not appear heroic. As a result, David read those comics in secret, beginning with his first Marvel book, Fantastic Four Annual #3 (November 1965), which saw the wedding of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman. His parents eventually allowed him to start reading superhero titles, his favorite of which was Superman. He cites John Buscema as his favorite pre-1970s artist. David attended his first comic book convention around the time that Jack Kirby's New Gods premiered, after asking his father to take him to one of Phil Seuling's shows in New York, where David obtained Kirby's autograph, his first encounter with a comics professional.\n",

He then worked as a researcher at the Acton Society Trust, before returning to the LSE as a lecturer in social sciences and administration. In 1964, he became professor and head of the Sociology and Social Policy Department at the University of Southampton; he retired in 1991. According to The Guardian, Smith \"played a leading role in developing the University of Southampton's social sciences faculty and was an authority on the social psychologist Elton Mayo\"; an industrial sociologist by specialism, he co-authored (with Nancy Seear and Pearl Jephcott) Married Working Women in 1962, as well as a number of other monographs and articles related to his discipline. He was a keen gardener, follower of cricket and fan of Hitchcock's thrillers and western films. He married Jean Horton in 1951 and had with her three children Christopher, Nigel and Rachel, who all survived him.\n",

    "text": "TNT is the ninth studio album by American country music singer Tanya Tucker. It was released on November 6, 1978, by MCA Records. Working with a new producer in Jerry Goldstein, Tucker drifts away from her earlier country style to do a much more rock-based effort. She covers well-known rock songs originally performed by such artists as Buddy Holly (\"Not Fade Away\"), Elvis Presley (\"Heartbreak Hotel\"), and Chuck Berry (\"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\"). Tucker also covers John Prine's \"Angel from Montgomery\". The album was Tucker's second-highest ranked ever on the Billboard Country charts at #2, and even reached #54 in the Pop category. Released singles and their Billboard positions were: \"Texas (When I Die)\" at #5, \"Not Fade Away\" at #70, and \"I'm the Singer, You're the Song\" at #18. While not necessarily embraced by the country music establishment, the album garnered critical and commercial success. It was certified Gold by the RIAA and earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female.\n",

When King Anouvong tried to assert himself as an independent kingdom, and raised an unsuccessful rebellion, it was obliterated by Siamese armies in 1827. The city was burned to the ground and was looted of nearly all Laotian artifacts, including Buddha statues and people. The Siamese routed Anouvong and razed the city leaving only the Wat Si Saket in good shape, shifting all people. Vientiane was in great disrepair, depopulated and disappearing into the forest, when the French arrived in 1867. It eventually passed to French rule in 1893. It became the capital of the French protectorate of Laos in 1899. The French rebuilt the city and rebuilt or repaired Buddhist temples such as Pha That Luang, Haw Phra Kaew, and left many colonial buildings behind. By a decree signed in 1900 by Governor-General Paul Doumer, the province was divided into four muang, these being Borikan, Patchoum, Tourakom, and Vientiane. Two years earlier, men from these four muang were responsible for building a house for the first administrator of Vientiane, Pierre Morin.\n",

The government often ignores citizens' privacy rights and laws regarding search warrants. Freedom House agrees; the site gave Ethiopia a six out of seven, which means that it is not free. Although fewer journalists have been arrested, detained, or punished in 2004 than in previous years, the government nevertheless continues to restrict freedom of the press. The government limits freedom of assembly, particularly for members of opposition groups, and security forces have used excessive force to break up demonstrations. Violence and discrimination against women continue to be problems. Female genital mutilation is widespread, although efforts to curb the practice have had some effect. The economic and sexual exploitation of children continues, as does human trafficking. Forced labor, particularly among children, is a persistent problem. Low-level government interference with labor unions continues. Although the government generally respected the free exercise of religion, local authorities at times interfere with religious practice. In order to improve Ethiopia's image, they hired US agencies to improve Ethiopia's image for $2.5 million. According to report of amnesty international 2016/2017 prolonged protests over political, economic, social and cultural grievances were met with excessive and lethal force by police. The report added that the crackdown on the political opposition saw mass arbitrary arrests, torture and other ill-treatment, unfair trials and violations of the rights to freedom of expression and association. On 9 October, the government announced a state of emergency, which led to further human rights violations. In September 2018, more than 20 have died in ethnic based attacks. Protestors outside the capital have been calling for the prime minister to issue a state of emergency to prevent further killings.\n",

She\u2019s got a real knack for setting the scene in her songwriting, and has a novelist\u2019s gift for conveying the kind of minute details in her lyrics that really put the listener in her head space. The tour was also reviewed by Nylon Magazine and MTV. Teeth & Tongue returned to the US in October of that year with a full band for CMJ Music Marathon where they appeared on USA Todays list CMJ 2012: What you should be listening to Now. Followed by a live performance on East Village Radio. Also in that year they were nominated for another EG Award, for Outstanding Achievement. Cornelius, as a solo act, joined a live 12-date SBS RocKwiz tour during 2012. She has appeared on the related TV show twice: in 2011 as a duet with Mike Rudd of cover version of Roy Orbison's \"Crying\", and in 2013 covering \"Take Another Little Piece of my Heart\" with Joe Camilleri. In 2013 Cornelius was one of the musical artists in the National Gallery of Victoria's exhibition, \"Wired for Melbourne Sound\"; where musicians wrote and recorded an extended play live in a public gallery. Evelyn Morris was also a part of the project.\n",

The generic name means \"sea runner\" (in reference to its supposed mode of feeding), and the specific name refers to the Egyptian god Seth due to its crest being supposedly reminiscent of Seth's crown. Other scholars have pointed out that the crest was instead similar to the crown of Amon, and Seth did not wear such a crown. A jaw tip was assigned to T. sethi in 2005, moved to the new genus Banguela in 2014, and assigned back to Thalassodromeus as the species T. oberlii in 2018. Another species (T. sebesensis) was named in 2015 based on a supposed crest fragment, but this was later shown to be part of a turtle shell. The closest relative of Thalassodromeus was Tupuxuara; both are grouped in a clade that has been placed within either Tapejaridae (as the subfamily Thalassodrominae) or within Neoazhdarchia (as the family Thalassodromidae).\n",

    "text": "Popular Soviet Songs and Youth Music is the sixth album by the British avant-garde music group :zoviet*france:, who, when it was recorded, identified themselves as :zoviet-france:. Recorded in 1984 and 1985, it was first released in 1985 by the band's label Singing Ringing in collaboration with Red Rhino in double cassette format. The packaging was elaborate and very labour-intensive to create; the cassettes sat inside a sculpted, clear-glazed ceramic box with a short length of twine with a hand-painted stick on the end sticking out of the bottom. A seabird feather gathered from the beach at Seascale (one mile from the Sellafield nuclear reactor) was stuck through a hole in each side of the box, held in place with sealing wax, which held the cassettes in. The inserts included a parody of the American flag (with mini-hammer and sickles in place of the stars) silk-screened on muslin, a piece of paper with art silk-screened on it, and a professionally printed sheet of paper with the track list and various sets of instructions for use of the package in English, Spanish and French, with most of them obviously being jokes (\"Remove feather by melting wax seal. Discard burnt cassettes. Retain box.\"). Staalplaat re-released it in triple CD format in 1994, with other editions in 1995 and 2004. These were packaged between two round felt pieces cut from black market Red Army caps, and held together with a Soviet military pin. The design on the front cover piece is by E. Van Weelden. The first edition was problematic; the intent was to sandwich the music CDs between CDs with tones on the play side and felt glued on the label side, but many copies wound up with the music CDs having the felt glued on them. The second and third editions don't have the tone CDs or the glued-on felt.\n",

After the absolutist reaction of 1823, he exiled to Britain and turned back in 1834, when Queen Regent Maria Christina signed the 'Estatuto Real'. He was elected member of the Parliament and also turned to his original progressive liberal positions back, giving support to Mendiz\u00e1bal cabinet of 1835 and his ecclesiastical confiscation policy. After the revolution of 1836, he was appointed member of the commission for composing the Constitution that was promulgated in 1837.

    "text": "In 1910, Rusk led an expedition to Mount McKinley sponsored by The Pacific Monthly, The Oregonian, the New York Herald, and members of the Mazamas club. Rusk initiated the expedition when he wrote to Charles H. Sholes of the Mazamas and asked Sholes to join him in an expedition to the mountain. Sholes was unable to join him, but shouldered the responsibility of organizing the expedition and raising funds for it. Eventually, there were three others who accompanied Rusk on the expedition, A. L. Cool, Joseph Ridley, and Frank H. Rojec. Cool was a good friend of Rusk's from the area around Lake Chelan who was well known as an expert mountaineer and guide. Ridley was a forest ranger on the Mount Baker National Forest who had done much exploring and mapping in the area around Mount Baker. Rojec, the photographer for the expedition, worked for the Kiser Photography Company and was well known for his pictures of Western scenery. Their mission was to establish whether Dr. Frederick Cook had indeed made it to the summit, as well as to reach the summit themselves. From Seattle, they took the United States revenue cutter Tahoma to Cook Inlet. From there, they took the sternwheeler Alice up the Susitna River to the mouth of the Chulitna River and then hired a local to guide them up the Chulitna and then two miles up the Tokositna River where they established a base camp. From there they worked their way to the toe of the Ruth Glacier and then up the Ruth Glacier toward McKinley. It was terribly difficult work because for each mile they advanced, they were required to travel five miles back and forth to get all their equipment up the glacier. They also had underestimated the amount of food they needed for the expedition so Cool returned to the base camp to wait for the return of their guide with more supplies. Rusk, from information given to him by S. P. Beecher, a member of the Cook expedition, and after some exploration up a tributary glacier opposite Mount Church, quickly became convinced that Cook had not actually climbed McKinley, but instead climbed a much shorter peak about 20 miles from McKinley. Rusk named four peaks at the head of this tributary glacier: Mounts Sholes, Mazama, Glisan, and Lee. Sholes, Glisan, and Lee were named after prominent members of the Mazamas club. From there they proceeded up the Ruth Glacier passing through The Great Gorge and into the Ruth Amphitheater. At this point, Rusk no longer had any doubts that Cook had not summited McKinley. As he wrote in his article detailing the expedition, they \"realized that it would require perhaps weeks or months in which to explore a route to the summit, we realized how utterly impossible and absurd was the story of this man [Cook], who, carrying a pack, claims to have started from the mouth of the Tokositna on the eighth of September, and to have stood on the highest point of McKinley on the sixteenth of the same month. The man does not live who can perform such a feat!\" At this point, their food supplies were too low for them to continue further and they were forced to retreat back down the glacier. There was another expedition led by Professor Herschel Clifford Parker and Belmore Browne attempting to summit McKinley at the same time. They also failed to reach the summit due to similar circumstances and later reinforced Rusk's conclusion by finding the very rock that Cook took his famous picture on. The Mazamas expedition had other problems as well. Sometime while they were on the Ruth Glacier, one of the members attempted to kill Rusk by hitting him with a snowshoe, but could not bring himself to finish the job.\n",

When training Kazakh paratroops in Kazakhstan, he received news of the September 11 attacks. He was assigned to help Afghan freedom fighters overthrow the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. He joined forces with local tribal leader Hamid Karzai, who assisted the US invasion via his own guerrilla war. In Uruzgan, Amerine with his Americans and Karzai with his freedom fighters both defended the town of Tarin Kowt from a Taliban attack. Next, the leaders marched on a campaign along the Arghandab River, fighting the Taliban at Shawali Kowt and Sayyd Alma Kalay. Both were US-Afghan victories, eventually leading to the capture of Kandahar, an Islamic spiritual center. Shortly after Karzai was elected to be interim leader of Afghanistan, Amerine was hit by friendly fire from a bomber. He lost three of his friends in the explosion, and learned three days later (in a hospital in Germany) that Kandahar had finally fallen, ending the war. After recovering, he completed a master's degree in international affairs with an emphasis in national security at the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, then taught at West Point as a Social Sciences, and later, an Arabic Language teacher.\n",

    "text": "Bob Davidson on occasion went by the nickname \"Rugged Robert\" by his teammates. He played his entire NHL career with the Toronto Maple Leafs. He played in the NHL from 1933\u201334 to 1945\u201346. He played on two Stanley Cup winning teams. His first was in 1941\u201342 and his second in the 1944\u201345 season in which he was Captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Bob Davidson served as Captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs from 1943\u201344 to 1944\u201345. After his playing days were over he stayed on with the Leafs organization in a number of different capacities. His most notable was as Chief Scout. Bob Davidson is considered by many to be one of the best hockey scouts of all time and was credited with building the Toronto Maple Leafs teams during the 1960s which dominated the NHL by winning the Stanley Cup four times (1961\u201362, 1962\u201363, 1963\u201364, 1966\u201367) within a six-year period. Davidson name was engraved on the cup 1962, 1967, but was a member of all 4 cups wins by Toronto in the 1960s. In 1995 the Board of Directors of the Toronto Maple Leafs organization awarded Bob Davidson with the J. P. Bickell Memorial Award.\n",

The album was written, recorded, and completed in 2007 and was recorded in Los Angeles with engineer John Travis and was produced and mixed by Tue Madsen. The album also features artwork by Dave McKean. The Cleansing saw its release on September 18, 2007 and debuted at number 94 on the Billboard 200, selling 7,250 copies in its first week of release. The sales of that week ending combined with its later sales made The Cleansing one of the best-selling debut albums in Century Media history. With the success of their debut album, Suicide Silence were included to take part in Mayhem Festival that took place during the summer of 2008. Afterward, they toured Europe with Parkway Drive and Bury Your Dead, following a successful US tour with the same bands. Suicide Silence then followed along with a tour in Australia with Parkway Drive, A Day to Remember and The Acacia Strain in mid-2008 during the time when they were included to perform at Sweat Fest. At this point, Suicide Silence was beginning to gain a wide range of fans throughout the world. While returning home from the continuous tours, the band covered the song \"Engine No.\u00a09\" by Deftones, and released the cover on their limited edition Green Monster single as well as iTunes all during the same year.\n",

The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1960s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts.\n",

John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, the second illegitimate son of John of Gaunt, was raised to the second marquessate as the Marquess of Dorset in September 1397. In 1399, he was disgraced, and the king revoked his marquessate. The House of Commons of England later petitioned King Henry IV for his restoration, but the King objected stating \"the name of marquess is a strange name in this realm\". From that period the title appears to have been dormant until it was revived by Henry VI in 1442. The only woman to be appointed as a marquess in her own right was Anne Boleyn, who was created Marchioness of Pembroke in preparation for her marriage to Henry VIII. The investiture ceremony was held at Windsor Castle on 1 September 1532.\n",

His book, Troop Leader: A Tank Commander's Story is a rare example of the experiences of front line tank warfare in the Second World War written not from an analytical point of view, but as a diary of the events which happened. He was one of the first British soldiers to be able to wander unhindered in the ruins of Berlin's government area in the immediate post cease fire period of 1945. On 5 March 1945 Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery presented him with the Military Cross, for his bravery during the battle for the hamlet of Doornhoek, near Berlicum in the Netherlands, in October 1944. Under heavy German machine-gun, mortar and shell fire, and in a minefield, he retrieved his burning tank and crew before overrunning the enemy's position to allow infantrymen to push through.\n",

He worked as a coalminer from a young age, travelling widely to Vancouver and California before settling in New South Wales in 1882. He mined at Newcastle and then at Bulli, and was a local secretary of the Miners' Union. In February 1891 he married Ellen Brodie in Sydney; they had four children. A foundation member of the Labour Party, he was one of the first group of Labour MLAs when he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Illawarra in 1891. He refused to take the pledge in 1893 and was elected to Woronora as an independent Labor member in 1894. He was a Free Trader briefly around 1898, but in 1904 rejoined the Labor Party. He transferred to the seat of Wollongong in 1904 and held it until 1917, when he was defeated after defecting to the Nationalist Party in the 1916 conscription split. Nicholson died in Woonona in 1919.\n",

    "text": "The church's founding can traced to June 1869 when the Basel missionary, the Rev. Fritz Augustus Ramseyer, his wife, Rosa, brother, Johannes and Thomas Owusu, a native Akan Christian convert were captured by the Adubofour-led army of the Asante Kingdom. After half-a-decade of failed negotiations to secure their release, the British colonial authorities invaded Kumasi and freed the four political prisoners. Ramseyer desired to return to Kumasi as a Christian missionary. In 1896, the British colonial authorities invaded Kumasi again and detained the Asantehene, Otumfuo Agyemang Prempeh I, the Queen mother and royal courtiers, taking them as hostages to Elmina on the coast and then to the Seychelles. Shortly thereafter, Fritz Ramseyer returned to Kumasi as a missionary, twenty-two years after his release. Ramseyer purchased land in the suburb of Bantama near the current site of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital with the assistance of Thomas Owusu. After one year, Ramseyer and his team had established two mission stations and two schools. The British military conquest of Kumasi that preceded the founding of the mission station there made the project unpopular among the natives as they viewed the Christian missionaries as colonial agents and Christians as the \u201creligion of the victor\u201d. By 1900, by the end of the last Anglo-Ashanti war led by Yaa Asantewaa, the Queenmother of Ejisu, Ramseyer and the Basel Mission had set up 16 schools in Kumasi with a total enrollment of 311 pupils. Furthermore, 33 baptisms had been recorded and 160 converts lived in the Christian village. \u00a0 Shortly after the end of 1900 war, Fritz and Rosa Ramseyer returned to Europe to recover from post-war trauma. Ramseyer returned to the Gold Coast on 13 December 1901 and led efforts to reorganize the church even though this was opposed by the Basel Mission's Home Committee in Switzerland. The construction of the chapel and minister's conference was in 1907, with communal labour offered by the church's congregation composed of mostly African converts. After the chapel building was completed, it was named the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church. Upon the death of Ramseyer on 6 August 1914, the church leadership under the then moderator, the Rev. C. E. Martinson renamed the church, the Ramseyer Memorial Presbyterian Church in Fritz Ramseyer's memory. In 1938, a healing and prayer fellowship was started at the church in conjunction with congregants from the Assemblies of God.\n",

    "text": "On July 28, 2006, the Nationals acquired Martis from the San Francisco Giants for veteran lefty reliever Mike Stanton. He joined the roster of Savannah of the South Atlantic League on August 1, 2006. After going 1\u20131 with a 3.80 ERA in four starts at Savannah, Martis was promoted to Washington's Potomac club in the High A Carolina League. He pitched two games in Potomac, giving up 4 earned runs in 12 innings, and finished the season at Harrisburg in the Double-A Eastern League, allowing 7 earned runs over 5 innings in his only appearance of the Harrisburg season. In , Martis pitched for Potomac the entire season. In 26 starts and one relief appearance, he logged a 4.23 ERA over 151 innings, striking out 108 batters while issuing just 52 walks. Martis was assigned to Harrisburg to begin the season. After going 4\u20134 with a 3.98 ERA and a respectable 1.35 WHIP in 14 starts at Harrisburg, he was promoted on June 21 to Triple-A Columbus, where he went 1\u20132 and accrued a 3.02 ERA in 7 starts, striking out 42 batters and walking 17. He was selected as a member of the World Team for the 2008 All-Star Futures Game in Yankee Stadium. Martis was called up to the major-league roster on September 2, with the intent of assigning him to the bullpen. However, an injury to rotation member Collin Balester caused Martis to put into the starting rotation. He made his major league debut September 4, 2008, against the Atlanta Braves. He gave up 2 runs in 5 innings, getting the loss. He struck out the first batter he faced, Gregor Blanco. Chipper Jones got the first hit off Martis. In his first plate appearance, he drew a walk from Braves rookie James Parr, who, like Martis, was also making his first major-league appearance. Martis struck out Parr in Parr's first at-bat earlier in the game. Martis got his first major league win on September 23, 2008, against the Florida Marlins. On May 2, 2009, against the St. Louis Cardinals, Martis pitched his first career complete game, which was the Nationals' first complete game since Pedro Astacio's in 2006 against the Atlanta Braves.\n",

He attended the Art Students League of New York (1948\u20131950) and the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Art (1950\u20131951). In the early 1950s Krushenick supported himself and his family by designing window displays for department stores and working for the Whitney and Metropolitan museums and the Museum of Modern Art. In 1957, he and his brother, John Krushenick, opened a framing shop on Tenth Street, which quickly turned into an artists' cooperative called Brata Gallery. Artists such as Al Held, Ronald Bladen, Ed Clark, Yayoi Kusama, and George Sugarman exhibited there. In 1962, Krushenick left the gallery and began receiving solo-exhibitions around the world. In the 1960s and 1970s, he was a prominent painter in the New York art scene. However, in his later years, Krushenick taught at the University of Maryland, College Park from 1977 to 1991. He died in New York on February 5, 1999, at age 69.\n",

Use of recombinant AAV (rAAV) has been successful in clinical trials addressing a variety of diseases. This lab-made progeny of rAAV is termed \"self-complementary\" because the coding region has been designed to form an intra-molecular double-stranded DNA template. A rate-limiting step for the standard AAV genome involves the second-strand synthesis since the typical AAV genome is a single-stranded DNA template. However, this is not the case for scAAV genomes. Upon infection, rather than waiting for cell mediated synthesis of the second strand, the two complementary halves of scAAV will associate to form one double stranded DNA (dsDNA) unit that is ready for immediate replication and transcription. The caveat of this construct is that instead of the full coding capacity found in rAAV (4.7-6kb) scAAV can only hold about half of that amount (\u22482.4kb).\n",

    "text": "For one who has studied the texts of Hasidism, and has responded to their \"Wellsprings\", they can then carry this mystical perspective into daily life. Especially opportune, in traditional Hasidic life, was seeking times of solitude amongst Nature. In Breslov Hasidism, the simple prayers of one's heart in such a setting (Hitbodedut) becomes of central importance. Rabbi Nachman of Breslav poetically depicts the spiritual lifeforce in the grasses of the field as joining and helping in one's prayers. Psychologically too, the aesthetic beauty of Nature becomes elevated by seeing the Divine transcendence reflected in it. To a sensitised soul, a tree can take on the extra dimension of a mystical beauty, that unites the Divine immanence of God with the transcendence. Divine transcendence and immanence are traditional notions in Jewish thought. The Panentheism of the Baal Shem Tov gave new emphasis on the theology and perception of the immanent Divine in all things. This carried earlier Kabbalistic notions, that saw Nature as a manifestation of God, to their theological conclusions. (The Kabbalists explain that one of the Hebrew names of God \"Elo-h-im\", representing Divine immanence, is numerically equivalent in Gematria with \"HaTeva\" meaning \"Nature\"). In the second section of the Tanya, Schneur Zalman of Liadi articulated the philosophical explanations of this. Similarly, the Baal Shem Tov gave a new interpretation of Divine Providence, that described how the movement of a leaf in the wind is significant in the Divine plan. A tale of the Baal Shem Tov also depicts the relationship between consciousness of the Divine immanence in Nature, infused with the higher light of Divine transcendence:\n",

Politically, Ochs described himself as a \"left social democrat\" who turned into an \"early revolutionary\" after the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which had a profound effect on his state of mind. Some of his best known protest songs include \"Power and the Glory\", \"Draft Dodger Rag\", \"There but for Fortune\", \"Changes\", \"Crucifixion\", \"When I'm Gone\", \"Love Me, I'm a Liberal\", \"Links on the Chain\", \"Ringing of Revolution\", and \"I Ain't Marching Anymore\". Other notable voices of protest from the period included Joan Baez, Buffy Sainte-Marie (whose anti-war song \"Universal Soldier\" was later made famous by Donovan), and Tom Paxton (\"Lyndon Johnson Told the Nation\" - about the escalation of the war in Vietnam, \"Jimmy Newman\" \u2013 the story of a dying soldier, and \"My Son John\" \u2013 about a soldier who returns from war unable to describe what he's been through), among others. The first protest song to reach number one in the United States was P.F. Sloan's \"Eve Of Destruction\", performed by Barry McGuire in 1965.\n",

The house was built in 1854 for Caroline Moore Robinson, the widow of Madison County Sheriff William Robinson. It represents a shift in architecture from Neoclassical to more eclectic forms that would become prominent in the late 19th century. The main block of the house is rectangular, with an ell off the rear and a two-story porch following the ell. The hipped roof is truncated to form a rooftop deck. A two-story, three-room, servants' quarters is connected to the house via the porch. Centered on the fa\u00e7ade is a single-story hipped roof porch supported by six slender, octagonal columns with corbelled arches in the architraves. A similar porch extends along the west side of the house. 5 large six-over-six sash windows stretch across the second floor, while the side of the house has two windows centered between two chimneys, with another window outside of them. There were originally two separate staircases which led to the divided second floor, but they were combined and the second floor joined by second owner Erskine Mastin. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\n",

    "text": "Elam was part of the early urbanization during the Chalcolithic period (Copper Age). The emergence of written records from around 3000 BC also parallels Sumerian history, where slightly earlier records have been found. In the Old Elamite period (Middle Bronze Age), Elam consisted of kingdoms on the Iranian plateau, centered in Anshan, and from the mid-2nd millennium BC, it was centered in Susa in the Khuzestan lowlands. Its culture played a crucial role during the Persian Achaemenid dynasty that succeeded Elam, when the Elamite language remained among those in official use. Elamite is generally considered a language isolate unrelated to the much later arriving Persian and Iranic languages; however, some linguists hypothesize that Elamite and the Dravidian languages of India belong to the same language family. In accordance with geographical and archaeological matches, some historians argue that the Elamites comprise a large portion of the ancestors of the modern day Lurs, whose language, Luri, split from Middle Persian.\n",

According to a study by Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), Chennai attracts about 40 percent of the country's medical tourists. As of 2013, the city receives up to 200 foreign patients every day. The Coromandel Express, which plies between Kolkata and Chennai, is nicknamed 'Ambulance Express' in Howrah since it regularly ferries a chunk of patients from the eastern region for medical treatment at hospitals in Chennai. Foreigners, especially those from developing and underdeveloped countries such as Nigeria, Kenya, Burundi, Congo, Bangladesh, Oman and Iraq, come to the city for advanced medical care. About 150 Maldivian patients arrive at the city every day for medical treatment, which resulted in Maldivian Airlines launching a thrice-a-week direct flight from Male to Chennai. However, there are no consolidated statistics about the number of foreign patients that the city receives. Most leading hospitals, which receive a steady stream of patients from other states of India and abroad every day, have separate wings for international patients. Sri Ramachandra Medical Centre receives up to 100 overseas patients a month. Dr.Kamakshi Memorial Hospital receives 10 to 15 foreign patients in a month. Fortis Malar Hospital receives 15 to 20 foreign patients a month. Madras Medical Mission receives 14 foreign medical tourists every month, mainly from East African nations. Sankara Nethralaya receives nearly 500 overseas patients a month. MIOT Hospitals receives nearly 300 foreign patients every month.\n",

Rivers' more recent film credits include the suspense thriller Hangman (2017) starring Al Pacino and Karl Urban, also Den of Thieves (2018) starring Gerard Butler and Curtis (50 Cent) Jackson . Over the years Jermaine Rivers has proven himself to be a diverse actor that can be cast in a multitude of character roles. His performances as Shatter on The Gifted (2017) showcased his physical abilities as he performed all of his own stunts. His ability to deliver tongue in cheek comedy was made apparently clear in his portrayal of (Rod) in the horror-comedy The Night Sitter (2018).

    "text": "This species was first described in the Mantissa Plantarum Altera by the famous Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1771, who named it Protea pubera. However, he cited Leucadendron oleaefolium (now Leucospermum oleifolium) by Peter Jonas Bergius as a synonym, making P. pubera a superfluous name. In 1809, Joseph Knight published a book titled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, that contained an extensive revision of the Proteaceae attributed to Richard Anthony Salisbury. Salisbury assigned four species to his new genus Leucadendrum that are now considered synonymous: L. puberum, L. gnaphaliifolium, L. xeranthemifolium and L. calligerum. It is assumed that Salisbury had based his review on a draft he had been studying of a paper called On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae that Robert Brown was to publish in 1810. Brown however, called the genus Leucospermum and made the new combination Leucospermum puberum. Salisbury's names were ignored by botanists in favour of those that Brown had created, and this was formalised in 1900 when Leucospermum was given priority over Leucadendrum. Otto Kuntze assigned puberum in 1891 to Leucodendron (making a spelling error). In 1969, John Patrick Rourke made the new combination Leucospermum calligerum. L. calligerum is the type species of the section Diastelloidea or louse pincushions.\n",

When single member electorates were restored in 1927, he again became the member for Lachlan until his retirement in 1938. With Michael Bruxner he was one of the 'true blue' progressives who refused to support a coalition government with George Fuller's Nationalists. Bruxner's faction became the Country Party with Bruxner as the leader and Buttenshaw the deputy leader. Bruxner resigned the leadership for family reasons in late 1925 and was succeeded by Buttenshaw. After the 1927 election of the Nationalist/Country Party coalition government led by Thomas Bavin, Buttenshaw became the Minister for RailCorp (1927\u20131929) and Minister for Public Works (1927\u20131930). He was the Acting Premier while Bavin was on a loan raising trip to the United Kingdom between April and August 1929. In 1932, Buttenshaw stood down in favour of Bruxner and became deputy leader again. He held the position of Minister for Lands in the government of Bertram Stevens. Buttenshaw retired at the 1938 election and died in Sydney in 1950. He was a keen tennis player and coached Harry Hopman.\n",

Fowler was runner-up with Erik Compton at \u22121, best finishes for both at a major, but they were eight strokes behind champion Martin Kaymer. Fowler had another second-place finish, at the Open Championship at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake, England. He began the final round six strokes behind Rory McIlroy and finished the day tied for second with Sergio Garc\u00eda at \u221215, two strokes behind McIlroy. At the next major in August, the PGA Championship, Fowler, Phil Mickelson, Henrik Stenson, and McIlroy battled for the title on a rain-soaked Valhalla Golf Club, near Louisville. Despite holding the lead for a good portion of the day, Fowler tied for third. He was only the third player, along with Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods, to have finished in the top 5 in all four majors in one calendar year, but the first not to win (Jordan Spieth became the fourth player in 2015). Fowler had 10 top-10 finishes during the 2013\u201314 season. His 8th-place finish at The Tour Championship moved him to 10th in the world golf rankings.\n",

After divorcing her husband, Tommy Mottola, Carey released Butterfly (1997). With her next release, Rainbow (1999), Carey incorporated elements of R&B and hip hop into her music, particularly on the lead single \"Heartbreaker\". According to The Sacramento Bee, she attempted to sound more \"ghetto\". She stopped working with longtime pop producers such as Babyface and Walter Afanasieff, in order to pursue a new sound and audience, and worked with writers Sean Combs and Jermaine Dupri. Following the worldwide success of Rainbow, Carey left Columbia Records. Controversially, Mottola and executive Benny Medina in 1999 used several songs Carey had written and co-written for Jennifer Lopez. Carey's 2001 film debut Glitter was panned by movie critics, and earned less than eight million dollars at the box office.\n",

On the ensuing drive, Rob Johnson threw an interception deep in his own territory to linebacker Marvin Jones, and the Jets capitalized with Vinny Testaverde finding fullback Richie Anderson for a 4 yard touchdown on the very next play to make it 14-0 Jets. Johnson answered with a 46 yard touchdown pass to Eric Moulds, but a failed two-point conversion kept the score at 14-6. The next Bills drive lasted only one play as linebacker Mo Lewis sacked Johnson and forced him to fumble, with lineman John Abraham returning the fumble 7 yards for another Jets touchdown. The next play from scrimmage featured an injury. Just as he had two weeks earlier when he knocked out Drew Bledsoe against the Patriots to begin the Tom Brady era, Mo Lewis hit Rob Johnson at the end of a 17 yard run and knocked him out of the game, forcing longtime backup Alex Van Pelt to take over at quarterback.\n",

    "text": "After World War II, Slim began leading bands that generally included saxophones, bass, drums, and piano, reflecting the popular appeal of jump blues. With the decline of blues recording by the major labels, Slim worked with emerging independent labels. Starting in late 1945, he recorded with trios for the small Chicago-based Hy-Tone Records. With a lineup of alto saxophone, tenor sax, piano, and string bass (Willie Dixon played the instrument on the first session), he signed with the Miracle label in the fall of 1946. One of the songs recorded at the first session was the ebullient boogie \"Rockin' the House,\" from which his band would take its name. Slim and the House Rockers recorded mainly for Miracle through 1949, with some commercial success. Among the songs they recorded were \"Messin' Around\" (which reached number one on the R&B charts in 1948) and \"Harlem Bound\". In 1947, the day after producing a concert by Slim, Broonzy, and Williamson at New York City's Town Hall, the folklorist Alan Lomax brought the three musicians to the Decca Records studios and recorded with Slim on vocal and piano. Lomax presented sections of this recording on BBC Radio in the early 1950s as a documentary, The Art of the Negro, and later released an expanded version as the LP Blues in the Mississippi Night. In 1949, Slim expanded his combo to a quintet by adding a drummer; the group was now spending most of its time on tour, leading to off-contract recording sessions for King Records in Cincinnati and Peacock Records in Houston.\n",

    "text": "In 88 BC Lucius Cornelius Sulla marched his legions on Rome starting a civil war. Quintus Sertorius, a client of Gaius Marius, joined his patron's faction and took up the sword against the Sullan faction (mainly optimates). After the death of Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Gaius Marius, Sertorius lost faith with his factions leadership. In 82 BC, during the second war against Sulla, he left Italy for his assigned propraetorian province in Hispania. Unfortunately his faction lost the war in Italy right after his departure and in 81 BC Sulla sent Gaius Annius Luscus with several legions to take the Spanish provinces from Sertorius. After a brief resistance Sertorius and his men are expelled from Hispania. They end up in Mauretania in north-western Africa where they conquer the city of Tingis. Here the Lusitanians, a fierce Iberian tribe who were about to be invaded by a Sullan governor, approached him. They asked him to become their war leader in the fight against the Sullans. In 80 BC Sertorius landed at the little fishing town of Baelo near the Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar) and returned to Hispania. Soon after his landing he fought and defeated the Sullan general Fufidius (the aforementioned Sullan governor) at the Baetis river. After this, he defeated several Sullan armies and drove his opponents from Spain. Threatened by Sertorius' success the Senate in Rome upgraded Hispania Ulterior to a proconsular province and sent the proconsul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius with a large army to fight him. Sertorius used guerrilla tactics so effectively he wore down Metellus to the point of exhaustion while his legate Lucius Hirtuleius defeated the governor of Hispania Citerior Marcus Domitius Calvinus. In 76 BC the government in Rome decided to send Pompey and an even larger army to help Metellus. In the same year Sertorius is joined by Marcus Perpenna, who brought him the remnants of the army of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the rebel consul of 78 BC. Thus reinforced Sertorius decided to try and take the Spanish east coast (because the cities there support his enemies). His first target was the city of Lauron where he outgeneraled Pompey and massacred a large part of his army (see: the Battle of Lauron).\n",

The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was carried out in a CIA-led operation with Joint Special Operations Command, commonly known as JSOC, coordinating the Special Mission Units involved in the raid. In addition to SEAL Team Six, participating units under JSOC included the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)\u2014also known as \"Night Stalkers\"\u2014and operators from the CIA's Special Activities Division, which recruits heavily from former JSOC Special Mission Units.

    "text": "Felton Messina started practicing Karatedo in 1966, while studying in the University of Puerto Rico, city of Mayag\u00fcez, supervised by his first teacher, the Puerto Rican Edwin Hern\u00e1ndez in a style called Okinawan Kenpo Karatedo. In 1968 he was promoted to black belt 1st Degree and received the grade certificate from Edwin Hern\u00e1ndez. In 1969, Felton Messina returned to the Dominican Republic having graduated as an electrical engineer. When he arrived in Santo Domingo, the only martial arts practiced there, were Judo and Taekwondo. When a group of young people heard of his arrival, they asked him to teach them the style of striking martial art that he had learned in Puerto Rico. In 1969 the Kenpo Karatedo Association was formed by Felton Messina, and this new style spread throughout the whole Caribbean nation. While being president of the Dominican Judo Federation, he was advised by the president of the Dominican Olympic Committee, to form what to this day is known as the Dominican Karate Federation (DOKAFE), which was recognized as well by the Dominican Olympic Committee. With the recognition of DOKAFE by the Dominican Olympic Committee Felton Messina quits from his position as President of the Dominican Judo Federation and becomes the first president of the Dominican Karate Federation. In 1975, Felton Messina stops practicing Okinawan Kenpo and begins practicing the Nihon Koden Shindo Ryu style of Karatedo under the teachings of Hiroyuki Hamada, native from the province of Sendai, Japan.\n",

It was fought mostly in the Caucasus mountains area in the 1260s after the destruction of Baghdad in 1258. The war overlaps with the Toluid Civil War in the Mongol Empire between two members of the Tolui family line, Kublai Khan and Ariq B\u00f6ke, who both claimed the title of Great Khan (Khagan). Kublai allied with Hulagu, while Ariq B\u00f6ke sided with Berke. Hulagu headed to Mongolia for the election of a new Khagan to succeed M\u00f6ngke Khan, but the loss of the Battle of Ain Jalut to the Mamluks forced him to withdraw back to the Middle East. The Mamluk victory emboldened Berke to invade the Ilkhanate. The Berke\u2013Hulagu war and the Toluid Civil War as well as the subsequent Kaidu\u2013Kublai war marked a key moment in the fragmentation of the Mongol empire after the death of M\u00f6ngke, the fourth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire.\n",

With the defeat of Axis forces in the North African campaign in May 1943, Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, who at least as far back as the Gallipoli campaign in World War I had a deep interest in the region, turned his sights on the islands. The British envisaged an operation to capture the Dodecanese and Crete, to deprive the Axis of excellent forward bases in the Mediterranean and to apply pressure on neutral Turkey to join the war. This would promote a favorite idea of Churchill's, that of a \"route through the Dardanelles to Russia as an alternative to the Arctic convoys.\" In the Casablanca Conference, the go-ahead was given and Churchill ordered his commanders to have plans ready for 27 January 1943.\n",

Wales remained undefeated in the group stage, battling to draws with Hungary (thanks to a Charles goal), Mexico, and eventual runners-up Sweden. As Hungary also recorded three points, a play-off match ensued, and Wales came from behind at the R\u00e5sunda Stadium to advance with a 2\u20131 win; however, Charles was injured in the match and missed out on the rest of the tournament. The Welsh were eventually knocked out by Brazil in the quarter-finals thanks to a goal by Pel\u00e9 in the 66th minute: the Brazilians went on to win the competition.

He originally played as a goalkeeper when he first joined the club's youth set-up, but started playing on the left wing from the age of 14 onwards. He made his debut for Scunthorpe at the age of 17 while a second-year scholar at the club, starting in a 2\u20131 victory over Bradford City in the Football League Trophy in October 2006. He also made an appearance as a second-half substitute in the same competition in the next round against Port Vale, with Scunthorpe losing the tie 5\u20133 on a penalty shoot-out, drawing 0\u20130 after extra-time. The following season, Winn made four first-team appearances for the club, all of which came in Scunthorpe's league campaign. During the early stages of the 2008\u201309 season, Mansfield Town registered their interest in Winn, hoping to secure his services on loan. Later that month, however, he was sent on loan to Northwich Victoria from October 2008 until January 2009, playing nine games, and scoring once against Salisbury City in a 1\u20131 draw. He had a trial at York City in February, playing in a reserve team game against Grimsby Town, although no move materialised. Winn joined Barrow on an emergency one-month loan in February 2009, where he played three times before returning to his parent club.\n",

In 1969 he published the first part of The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin, a satirical novel about a Russian soldier during World War II. It was followed two years later by a second part. At the outset of the Brezhnev stagnation period, Voinovich's writings stopped being published in the USSR, but continued publishing in samizdat and in the West. In 1974, the authorities began a systematic harassment of Voinovich due to his writing and his political attitude. Voinovich was excluded from the Soviet Writers' Union the same year. His telephone line was cut off in 1976 and he and his family were forced to emigrate in 1980, being stripped of his citizenship. He settled in Munich, West Germany after being invited by the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich and for a while worked for Radio Liberty. Voinovich helped publish Vasily Grossman's famous novel Life and Fate by smuggling photo films secretly taken by Andrei Sakharov. In 1987, he published the second of his arguably most well-known works, Moscow 2042. Mikhail Gorbachev restored his Soviet citizenship in 1990 and he subsequently moved back to Russia.\n",

    "text": "In 1975 retired geologist and researcher Christian O'Brien suggested that Portingbury Hills had a purpose in archaeoastronomy and was constructed in the Bronze Age which gave it some brief coverage in the Sunday Telegraph. O'Brien suggested that the mound was aligned astronomically with Wandlebury Hill via a series of equally spaced, hand-carved, stone monoliths forming a Loxodrome. Eleven of the original twenty-six markers are still in situ, such as the Leper Stone, with several of the other distinctive stones lying nearby. O'Brien's theory met with mixed reviews from astronomers and archaeologists. Glyn Daniel, Professor of Archaeology at Cambridge University dismissed the paper as \"nonsense\" and Alexander Thom could find nothing in it to revise the documented view of Wandlebury as an Iron Age Fort. Archie Roy, Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow University commented that \"in the absence of a more convincing explanation, this conclusion also has to be taken very seriously.\u201d \n",

However, they dropped further tier, to Liga Bet (now as fourth tier), after they finished bottom in Liga Alef South at the following season. Eleven years later, in the 1987\u201388 season, Hapoel won Liga Bet South B division and returned to Liga Alef, where they played until they were relegated back to Liga Bet, at the end of the 1994\u201395 season.

The electorate returned a vote for the latter proposition, and in October 1923 Coghlan became the first Premier of Southern Rhodesia. Although Guest was on the opposite side to Coghlan the statesman was impressed by his capabilities, and when he drew up a list of those he would like to see stand for election to the next Legislative Assembly, just before his death, he put Guest's name at the head of it. Guest first stood for Charter, representing the Rhodesia Party at the 1928 elections. Despite the constituency being largely Afrikaans, he won the seat, defeating the incumbent Charles Edward Gilfillan of the Progressive Party with a majority of 283 votes to 211. He held Charter until 1946, being re-elected in 1933, 1934 (unopposed) and 1939. At the 1946 elections he stood for Salisbury Gardens and won, remaining there until his retirement from politics in 1948.\n",

In the same report, these authors also reported the exquisite anticancer activity of halichondrin B against murine cancer cells both in culture and in in vivo studies. Halichondrin B was highly prioritized for development as a novel anticancer therapeutic by the United States National Cancer Institute and, in 1991, was the original test case for identification of mechanism of action (in this case, tubulin-targeted mitotic inhibitor) by NCI's then-brand-new \"60-cell line screen\" The complete chemical synthesis of halichondrin B was achieved by Yoshito Kishi and colleagues at Harvard University in 1992, an achievement that ultimately enabled the discovery and development of the structurally simplified and pharmaceutically optimized analog eribulin (E7389, ER-086526, NSC-707389). Eribulin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on November 15, 2010, to treat patients with metastatic breast cancer who have received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens for late-stage disease, including both anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapies.

Westars 1, 2, and 3 were 12-transponder satellites while Westar 4 and Westar 5 were launched with 24 transponders. Western Union built a teleport in Cedar Hill, Texas, to uplink content to the Westar satellites (it was interconnected to WU's existing terrestrial microwave network at the time), and another teleport that, in addition to uplink services, would become the main TT&C (telemetry, tracking & control) center for the satellite (and for all of the Westar fleet later on), in Glenwood, New Jersey. A sixth satellite, Westar 6, was launched in 1984 but failed to reach orbit and was retrieved by the STS-51-A Space Shuttle mission later that year.

Corrigan was an understudy to Harry Dowd on City's 1969 FA Cup winner. Corrigan then established himself in the first team during the 1969\u201370 season, and was part of the Manchester City team which won a cup double of the UEFA European Cup Winners Cup and the League Cup. He was also a member of the 1976 League Cup winning side. His debut appearance for England came on 28 May 1976 against Italy, the first of a total of 9 caps, and he was part of the England squad for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. He would undoubtedly have played more time for England if his chances had not been limited by Peter Shilton and Ray Clemence. Corrigan also appeared for Manchester City in the 1981 FA Cup Final defeat by Tottenham Hotspur where he was named as man-of-the match. In total Corrigan made 592 appearances for Manchester City, a figure beaten only by Alan Oakes, and a club record for a goalkeeper. He also won Manchester City's Player of the Year award three times, a feat matched only by Richard Dunne. He is remembered as one of Manchester City's best goalkeepers along with Frank Swift and Bert Trautmann.\n",

He was born in New York, to Abraham Chaim Charlap, a member of the Sephardic rabbinical dynasty of Gedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph and a noted author and publisher of Hebrew texts and their English translations. Through his work with Herbert H. Lehman, he became involved with the Joint Distribution Committee, the largest and most encompassing of the organizations devoted to the Jewish refugee and rescue crisis during and after World War II, and was its vice chairman under Felix M. Warburg from 1922 until his retirement in 1947. Under his leadership the Joint Distribution Committee helped 81,000 Jews to emigrate out of Nazi-occupied Europe to safety, smuggled aid to Jewish prisoners in labor camps and provided financing for the Polish Jewish underground in preparations for the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto revolt. He was a key figure in keeping American Jewish leaders informed about the Holocaust and met with Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. and Secretary of State Cordell Hull to request visas for the 907 refugees aboard the MS St. Louis on June 1, 1939, which was unsuccessful. The events of the MS St. Louis tragedy are recorded in the 1976 film Voyage of the Damned. Apart from his activities within the JDC, he served as adviser to the League of Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, James G. McDonald, and was assistant to Felix M. Warburg as chairman of the administrative committee of the Jewish Agency for Palestine.\n",

Produced by former DC Talk member Jason Halbert, the song was written by artists who also have been members of various rock bands: Semi Precious Weapons lead singer Justin Tranter, former Cobra Starship lead guitarist Ryland Blackinton, Young Love lead singer Dan Keyes, and Oliver duo member Vaughn Oliver. A synth electro rock song, it sings of remembering nostalgia of a failed relationship, which was mainly based on Tranter's and Keyes's real life experiences. The record mainly features synthesizer sounds that were prominently popular during the 1980s as well as string arrangements by Joseph Trapanese and guitars by Tim Pierce. Upon the release of Piece by Piece, \"Nostalgic\" has received a very positive response from music critics, who lauded the track as one of the album's highlights and complimented the 1980s nostalgia evoked from the song.\n",

    "text": "Einhorn started Greenlight Capital in May 1996 with $900,000 in start up capital. In May 2002, he gave a speech at the Sohn Investment Research Conference where he recommended shorting a mid-cap financial company called Allied Capital eventually disclosing that he himself had a substantial short position. The day after the speech the company's stock went down by 20 percent. Einhorn alleged the company of defrauding the Small Business Administration while Allied said that Einhorn was engaging in market manipulation, and illegally accessed his phone records using pretexting. In June 2007, after a lengthy investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it found that Allied broke securities laws relating to the accounting and valuation of illiquid securities it held. After the incident, Einhorn has published a book, Fooling Some of the People All of the Time regarding this six-year fight. Reviews of the book were generally positive; Seeking Alpha, said of the book: \"the case against Allied Capital is laid out to the last detail. Because of the immense amount of data in the book, I would imagine that some readers may want to skip a page here and there. However, the book is by no means dull. This book proves that truth is really stranger than fiction.\" Einhorn would come to view Allied as a microcosm of market trends: \"What we've seen a year later is that Allied was the tip of an iceberg; that this kind of questionable ethic, philosophy and business practice was far more widespread than I recognized at the time...Our country, our economy, is paying a huge price for that.\"\n",

    "text": "In mathematics, a group scheme is a type of algebro-geometric object equipped with a composition law. Group schemes arise naturally as symmetries of schemes, and they generalize algebraic groups, in the sense that all algebraic groups have group scheme structure, but group schemes are not necessarily connected, smooth, or defined over a field. This extra generality allows one to study richer infinitesimal structures, and this can help one to understand and answer questions of arithmetic significance. The category of group schemes is somewhat better behaved than that of group varieties, since all homomorphisms have kernels, and there is a well-behaved deformation theory. Group schemes that are not algebraic groups play a significant role in arithmetic geometry and algebraic topology, since they come up in contexts of Galois representations and moduli problems. The initial development of the theory of group schemes was due to Alexander Grothendieck, Michel Raynaud and Michel Demazure in the early 1960s.\n",

    "text": "Labour Party president Moira Coatsworth stated that the leadership contest would be a \"robust contest of ideas\", and suggested to the party's caucus that a series of meetings with party members be held around New Zealand. These were held from 6 to 11 December in six major cities\u2014Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin and Auckland. The party membership was then encouraged to give feedback to the party caucus, who would vote in the election. On 30 November Cunliffe, Parker and Shearer were interviewed by Mark Sainsbury on the current affairs programme Close Up. The television show held a text message poll in which viewers voted for their preferred leader of the party. Over 7,500 people took part; Shearer received 50% of the support, Cunliffe 31% and Parker 19%. The following day, Parker pulled out of the leadership race and put his support behind Shearer. Shearer and Cunliffe were interviewed by Guyon Espiner on political talkshow Q+A on 4 December. During the interview, both candidates indicated their support for the introduction of a capital gains tax, which was a key part of Labour's tax policy during the 2011 general election campaign. Both also disagreed with the 2008 Employment Relations Amendment Act (90-day workplace trial), and wanted New Zealand to invest further in research and development; Shearer mentioned striving for a more green economy. On 9 December, Horizon Research released a demographically-weighted survey which found that 35.4% of adult New Zealanders supported Shearer's bid for the leadership, and 19.9% backed Cunliffe.\n",

A graph based on MBH99 was featured prominently in the 2001 IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR), and became a focus of the global warming controversy over the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. It was disputed by various contrarians, and in the politicisation of this hockey stick controversy the New York Times of 14 February 2005 hailed a paper by businessman Stephen McIntyre and economist Ross McKitrick (MM05) as undermining the scientific consensus behind the Kyoto agreement. On 23 June 2005, Rep. Joe Barton, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, with Ed Whitfield, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, wrote joint letters referring to issues raised by the Wall Street Journal article, and demanding that Mann, Bradley and Hughes provide full records on their data and methods, finances and careers, information about grants provided to the institutions they had worked for, and the exact computer codes used to generate their results. Boehlert said this was a \"misguided and illegitimate investigation\" into something that should properly be under the jurisdiction of the Science Committee, and in November 2005 after Barton dismissed the offer of an independent investigation organised by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Boehlert requested the review, which became the North Report.\n",

Clark to be his Airborne Advisor and in that capacity accompanied him to England. As a working member of the London Planning Group, he developed the initial concept and plan for the airborne phase of the Allied invasion of North Africa, codenamed Operation Torch. When the Paratroop Task Force departed Land's End, England on November 7, 1942, Yarborough, as executive officer (XO), accompanied it on its flight over Spain toward its target objectives in Algeria. This was the longest operational flight ever made by parachute troops. In the course of the ensuing action the airplane in which he was flying was shot down by Vichy French fighter aircraft over the Sebkra d'Oran. He participated in combat operations to capture Tafaroui Airdrome in Algeria. A week later, Yarborough parachuted into Youks les Bains Airfield near Tebessa, Algeria (near the Tunisian border) and fighting as part of a combined French and U.S. Paratroop Task Force in Tunisia until January 1943, when he returned to the United States.\n",

    "text": "After making the postseason for seven consecutive years, from 1981 to 1987, the Nordiques started to decline. From 1987\u201388 to 1991\u201392, the team finished last in their division every season, and three of those times they finished last in the league. This included a dreadful 12-win season in 1989\u201390 that is still the worst in franchise history. As a result, the team earned three consecutive first overall draft picks, used to select Mats Sundin (1989), Owen Nolan (1990) and Eric Lindros (1991). Lindros made it clear he did not wish to play for the Nordiques, to the extent he did not wear the team's jersey for the press photographs, only holding it when it was presented to him. On advice from his mother, he refused to sign a contract and began a holdout that lasted over a year. On June 30, 1992, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for five players, the rights to Swedish prospect Peter Forsberg, two first-round draft picks and US$15\u00a0million. The Eric Lindros trade turned the moribund Nordiques into a Stanley Cup contender almost overnight, and in hindsight is seen as one of the most one-sided deals in sports history. In the first season after the trade, 1992\u201393, the Nordiques reached the playoffs for the first time in six years. Two years later, they won the Northeast Division and had the second best regular-season record during the lockout-shortened season.\n",

After working for a time in what was then Soviet Georgia managing a large state-owned vineyard, he came to the United States in 1951. Speaking nine languages, English not being one of them, Frank was forced to take a job as a dishwasher in New York City. When he could save up enough, Frank moved with his family to the Cornell University Geneva Experiment Station in 1953. During the 1950s, he was a consultant to the Gold Seal Winery and established a Vitis vinifera grape nursery. He urged New York State winemakers to move away from native North American grapes, including Vitis labrusca and other species, and instead plant Vitis vinifera, the traditional grapes of European winemakers. For 300 years, failed attempts to plant \"Vitis vinifera\" varieties were blamed on the cold weather. With extensive experience growing the European grapes in below freezing temperatures back in Ukraine, Frank knew it would be possible with the techniques that he developed. \n",

The success of Halina Konopacka, a Polish athlete who won gold in the discus throw at the 1928 Summer Olympics, inspired Walasiewicz to join the local branch of Sok\u00f3\u0142, a Polish sports and patriotic organization active among the Polish diaspora. During the Pan-Slavic meeting of the Sok\u00f3\u0142 movement in Pozna\u0144, she scored her first major international victories; she won five gold medals in the 60 metre, 100 metre, 200 metre and 400 metre races, as well as the long jump. She was asked to stay in Poland and join the Polish national athletic team, and she continued to run in American challenges and games.\n",

I saw a good deal of Fredegond Shove, Gerald's wife, who lived like a Spartan at the Bailiff's Cottage.\" Their employer, Lady Ottoline Morrell, also remembered Fredegond then as \"an enchanting creature, very sensitive, delicate and highly strung, with a fantastic imagination\".\n",

Burma attained independence on 4 January 1948. Kachin State was formed in the same year out of the former British Burma civil districts of Bhamo and Myitkyina, together with the larger northern district of Puta-o. Kachin State was officially announced on 10 January 1948 and Kachin State Government held \"Mungdaw Masat Masat Manau\" (forming of Kacahin State Manau) for three consecutive days since 9 to 11 January as happiness since that year they held Manau on January 10 every year until Military in coup 1962. The vast mountainous hinterlands are predominantly Kachin, whereas the more densely populated railway corridor and southern valleys are mostly Shan and Bamar. The northern frontier was not demarcated and until the 1960s Chinese governments had claimed the northern half of Kachin State as Chinese territory since the 18th century.

    "text": "Prior to the 2013\u201314 season, Central FC and Walsall of Football League One agreed to a partnership that featured the Saddlers' in a pre-season tour of Trinidad and Tobago. As part of their agreement, Winchester was one of five one-week trialists at Walsall during its training sessions and exhibition matches against his previous club Stokely Vale and a Pro League XI. On 13 September 2013, Rundell opened the Pro League season with a goal in a 3\u20131 win over Pro League defending champions Defence Force. His strong start to the season was ultimately rewarded with a call-up to the national team. In October 2013, Winchester was named the most valuable player of the First Citizens Cup after scoring the winning goal to give Central FC its first major trophy in a 2\u20131 win over Defence Force in the final. Four days later, he recorded his first career hat-trick as a professional on 22 October against Point Fortin Civic. After his successful month, Winchester was named Pro League Player of the Month for October. Winchester concluded his second season with Central FC by leading the Sharks to the 2014 Goal Shield over rivals W Connection and winning his second most valuable player award of the season. Following the season, Winchester signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him with Central FC until the end of the 2015\u201316 season.\n",

    "text": "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas takes place in 1992 within the state of San Andreas, which is based on sections of California and Nevada. It comprises three major fictional cities: Los Santos corresponds to Los Angeles, San Fierro corresponds to San Francisco, and Las Venturas corresponds to Las Vegas. The environments around these cities are also based on settings within the Southwestern region of the United States. Players can drive up the half-mile (800\u00a0m) tall Mount Chiliad (based on Mount Diablo), parachute from various peaks and skyscrapers, and visit 12 rural towns and villages located in five counties: Red County, Flint County, Bone County, Tierra Robada, and Whetstone. Other notable destinations include Sherman Dam (based on the Hoover Dam), a vast secret military base called Area 69 (based on Area 51), a large satellite dish (based on a dish from the Very Large Array), Vinewood (based on Hollywood) and the Vinewood sign (based on the Hollywood sign) which is located in Mulholland, and many other geographical features. The bridges in San Fierro are based on the Forth road and rail bridges which link Edinburgh, the home of Rockstar North, to Fife, although the road bridge is highly similar to the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge. San Andreas is 13.9 square miles (36 square kilometres), almost four times as large as Vice City and five times as large as the Grand Theft Auto III rendition of Liberty City. The three cities are linked by numerous highways, a train system, and air travel. While its predecessors' areas were limited to urban locations, San Andreas includes not only large cities and suburbs but also the rural areas between them.\n",

The above mosques, although being successors of Seljuq architecture, differ greatly in the increase of decorations in the interior and exterior spaces and the different placement of the courtyards and minarets. Karaman beylik also left noteworthy architectural works, such as Ulucami Mosque in Ermenek (1302), Hatuniye Madrassa in Karaman (1382), Akmedrese Madrassa in Ni\u011fde (1409), all of which respect a new style that considers and incorporates the exterior surroundings also. One of the first examples of the Anatolian beylik architecture hinting at the forming of the Ottoman architecture that aims at uniting the interior space beneath one big dome and forming a monumental architectural structure is Ulucami Mosque in Manisa (1374) built by the Saruhan beylik. Also worth noting is the increase in constructions of madrassas that points at the beyliks' attaching greater importance to sciences.\n",

    "text": "A Buddhist temple had existed at the site of Wat Arun since the time of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. It was then known as Wat Makok, after the village of Bang Makok in which it was situated. (Makok is the Thai name for the Spondias pinnata plant.) According to the historian Prince Damrong Rajanubhab, the temple was shown in French maps during the reign of King Narai (1656\u20131688). The temple was renamed Wat Chaeng by King Taksin when he established his new capital of Thonburi near the temple, following the fall of Ayutthaya. It is believed that Taksin vowed to restore the temple after passing it at dawn. The temple enshrined the Emerald Buddha image before it was transferred to Wat Phra Kaew on the river's eastern bank in 1785. The temple was located in grounds of the royal palace during Taksin's reign, before his successor, Rama I, moved the palace to the other side of the river. It was abandoned for a long period of time, until the reign of King Rama II (1809\u20131824), who had the temple restored and the main pagoda raised to 70\u00a0m. The work was finished during the reign of King Rama III (1824\u20131851).\n",

The Union general in chief, Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant had ordered Sherman to bring his troops north to Virginia in order to battle the Army of Northern Virginia. However, Sherman argued that it would take too long to transport his troops there, and that his army could destroy Confederate supply lines to Petersburg and defeat Confederate forces by marching through the Carolinas. During the late winter and early spring of 1865, Sherman's army cut a swath of destruction through South Carolina. On March 8, Union soldiers crossed into North Carolina as Confederate units attempted to concentrate their forces to defeat the enemy during the march. Sherman divided his command into two parts, a Left Wing (the Army of Georgia) commanded by Maj. Gen. Henry Warner Slocum and a Right Wing (the Army of the Tennessee) commanded by Maj. Gen. Oliver Otis Howard. The two wings marched separately toward Goldsboro beginning on March 13, with no one in the Union command expecting major resistance from Johnston.\n",

After they lost the tag team titles, Harper betrayed Wyatt and departed from the group. Orton won the 2017 Royal Rumble match and Wyatt proceeded to win his first WWE Championship in February, with the pair going on to face each other at WrestleMania 33. Wyatt and Rowan continued their alliance as the last remaining members of The Wyatt Family until the 2017 WWE Superstar Shake-up, in which Wyatt was moved to Raw while Rowan remained on SmackDown, thus disbanding The Wyatt Family. However, Harper and Rowan would be repackaged together as The Bludgeon Brothers, where they would win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. While Bray Wyatt adopted his own alter-ego as the Fiend.\n",

Oakland hip-hop group Digital Underground criticized him in the CD insert of their Sex Packets album by placing Hammer's picture in it and referring to him as an unknown derelict. Q Tip criticized him in \"Check the Rhyme,\" asking, \"What you say Hammer? Proper. Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop.\" LL Cool J dissed him in \"To tha Break of Dawn\" (from the Mama Said Knock You Out album), calling Hammer an \"amateur, swinging a Hammer from a bodybag [his pants],\" and saying, \"My old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap.\", though this could have been seen as a response to Hammer calling him out in \"Let's Get it Started\", when he was mentioned along with Run-DMC and Doug E. Fresh as rappers that Hammer claimed to be better than. (LL Cool J would later compliment and commend Hammer's abilities/talents on VH-1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop, which aired in 2008). However, Ice-T came to his defense on his 1991 album O.G. Original Gangster: \"A special shout out to my man M.C. Hammer: a lot of people dis you, man, but they just jealous.\" Ice-T later explained that he had nothing against people who were pop-rap from the start, as Hammer had been, but only against emcees who switch from being hardcore or dirty to being pop-rap so that they can sell more records.\n",

He then attended Auburn University, where he majored in health and human performance. As a true freshman in 1995, he was named to the freshman All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) team. In 1996 as a sophomore, he recorded a career-high 80 tackles and was named Second-team All-SEC. As a junior in 1997, he recorded 78 total tackles. During the Tigers tenth game, against Georgia, he ruptured his patella on the first play of the game. Despite his injury, he was named First-team All-SEC. In 1998 he appeared in just three games. He recorded 11 tackles. Due to complications from the surgery, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) granted him a medical hardship, allowing him to return for another year. As a redshirt senior, in 1999, he recorded 51 tackles, six sacks, three fumble recoveries and nine quarterback hits.\n",

In the mid-1980s, in-vitro propagated banana plants became the leading product. Rahan is now a center of research and consultation for the banana industry throughout the world. A formal R&D department was established in 1991 to provide technical support. Areas of expertise include molecular and classical genetics, plant cell and tissue culture, plant biochemistry and physiology, bacteriology and industrial biotechnology. Methods have also been developed for the control of contaminating microbes, early detection and elimination of somaclonal variation, reduction of labor and fixed costs in production, etc.\n",

For the next year, she conducted operations along the East Coast between New London and Wilmington, North Carolina. During the first month of 1947, Tusk participated in a fleet tactical exercise in the Central Atlantic. A three-month overhaul at Philadelphia, followed by oceanographic work along the Atlantic shelf in conjunction with Columbia University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution occupied her until October 1947 when she entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for a Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program (GUPPY) conversion.\n",

    "text": "Minaj released her second studio album, , in April 2012. The lead single, \"Starships\", is a hybrid of genres, combining Eurodance, Europop and Euro house. It was written by Minaj in collaboration with Wayne Hector and its producers Carl Falk, RedOne and Rami Yacoub. They also wrote the songs \"Pound the Alarm\", \"Whip It\" and \"Automatic\" together. \"Pound the Alarm\" became her first song as a lead artist to peak at number one on the United States' Hot Dance Club Songs. Minaj reunited with Andrew \"Pop\" Wansel and Warren \"Oak\" Felder on the songs \"Right by My Side\" featuring Chris Brown and \"Fire Burns\". Critics noted how Minaj sings in addition to rapping on \"Right by My Side\", and described it as an upbeat take on a downtempo pop ballad. Minaj wrote the song \"Marilyn Monroe\" in collaboration with Ross Golan and its producers J. R. Rotem and production team Dreamlab. The American actress Marilyn Monroe is mentioned numerous times throughout the song, and its lyrics are inspired by a famous quote \"I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best\"; which is incorrectly attributed to Monroe.\n",

    "text": "Lowe returned to La Jolla in 1961 as a shy 15\u00bd-year-old red head with a passion for more cerebral jazz, folk and blues. She met a group of guys from Windansea Beach and joined them in the youth culture they created around surfing and beer bashes. With her fake ID, she rented a studio apartment in Pacific Beach and paid the rent with a $100 child support check from her father. She supplemented her income working at the first Hobie Surfboard Shop in San Diego County for Chuck Hasley, a former school teacher who would lead the Windansea team to victories in surf competitions. Lowe, who answered their fan mail, also participated in the surfer group, the Mac Meda Destruction Company founded by Jack Macpherson. She got pregnant just before the city discovered she was a 17-year-old truant. She moved to Palm Desert, where her mother and stepfather were publishing Desert Magazine. Her mother signed her marriage license and gave them a $100 gift. They divorced in 1966 after having two daughters, Sloane and Portia Perry. Lowe retained her married name, Ming Perry, and remained a part of the La Jolla scene while raising her daughters as a single parent. Tom Wolfe spent a summer in La Jolla and skimmed the surface of its \"underground society\" in his 1965 book, \" The Pump House Gang.\" Lowe was more integral to the real scene, helping her friend, Anchovie Barca, turn the Hippodrome ice skating rink into the Fillmore West of San Diego. She had a party with a blues band playing in her living room and police raided it for disturbing the peace. Twenty-one of Lowe's friends were arrested after police reported finding marijuana and peyote in the house of \"Mrs. Ming Perry, a 21-year-old divorcee and mother of two children\", according to the San Diego Union. Lowe recalled hearing herself called \"the Dragon Lady\" on radio. The counter-culture became prominent across the U.S. in 1966. Lowe was visiting a friend on the Sunset Strip when the riot broke out that inspired Stephen Stills to write \"For What It's Worth.\" She was invited in 1967 to the Monterey Pop Festival by Cass Elliott of the Mamas and the Papas, whose boyfriend was a surfer from Windansea. She was in the front row at the Altamont Festival when the West Coast scene came to a violent end during a set by the Rolling Stones. Other prominent figures from the 1960s, including comedian Jonathan Winters, English rocker Eric Burdon, Velvet Underground guitarist Sterling Morrison, Native American guitarist Jesse Ed Davis, blues legend Taj Mahal, and actors Brad Douriff from \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and Teddie Markland from \"Wanda Nevada\", began showing up at her back door after Ming bought a house in Palm Desert in 1967. The now posh destination was still part of the desert frontier when Ming built her own studio there. When Palm Springs had its own rock festival in 1969, about 60 friends slept on the floor and roof of Ming's house. Burdon called it \"a great meeting place for artists and travelers attracted to the desert.\"\n",

    "text": "The Yankees lost three in a row through the first three days of June, dropping the final 2 games of the four-game set against the Twins at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, then blitzed 9-3 by the Jays on Joba Chamberlain's first career start in the majors. The Yankees, however, won the next 2 against them including a wild comeback on June 5 that ended in a two-run, pinch hit homer into the upper deck by Jason Giambi after trailing 7-2 in the 6th inning. Following the series, Yankees split a 4-game weekend series with the Royals and took 2 out of 3 from the A's highlighted by Hideki Matsui celebrating his 34th birthday with a Grand Slam off of Joe Blanton. The Yankees would then sweep the Astros and were 4 games over .500 for the first time this season, but Chien-Ming Wang hurt his leg rounding the bases a 13-0 win. He was out for the rest of the season. The Yankees would then sweep the Padres at home to win 7 straight for the first time this season. The streak came to a halt on June 20, when they lost to Edinson V\u00f3lquez and the Reds 4-2 on the Reds' first visit to Yankee Stadium since 1976, the first season of the renovated Yankee Stadium. They would follow with a lopsided 6-0 loss in which they left 12 runners on base despite Dan Giese's great outing, but salvage the final game with a 4-1 win. The Yankees travel to PNC Park for the first time ever when they face the Pirates from June 24\u201325 before returning to New York to play a double header with their cross-town rival Mets. In game one, the Yankees were outmatched 15-6, but rebounded in the nightcap game two, with a 9-0 shutout.\n",

Grant's Army of the Tennessee had early successes in Kentucky and western Tennessee in 1861 and 1862, capturing the important strategic locations of forts Henry and Donelson. The Army of the Tennessee and the Army of the Ohio defeated the Confederate Army of Mississippi, commanded by General Albert Sidney Johnston, at the Battle of Shiloh, driving it out of western Tennessee, subsequently marching into Mississippi and capturing Corinth. Grant's troops marched towards and captured Vicksburg in 1862\u201363. Meanwhile, the Army of the Ohio, later known as the Army of the Cumberland, experienced success, blocking a Confederate invasion of Kentucky and gaining control over large amounts of Tennessee through the Battle of Stones River and the 1863 Tullahoma Campaign while fighting against the Confederate Army of Tennessee, whose commander, Braxton Bragg, was often criticized for his alleged lack of military skill. The Union army was briefly checked in its invasion of Georgia at the Battle of Chickamauga, and besieged at Chattanooga. Grant, now commanding the newly created Military Division of the Mississippi, took command, and received reinforcements from the Army of the Tennessee, as well as from the eastern Army of the Potomac. The siege of Chattanooga was lifted in November 1863. Following his elevation by Abraham Lincoln to General-in-Chief, Grant put Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in charge of the combined armies. Chattanooga served as a launching pad for Sherman to capture the Confederate rail-hub of Atlanta and to march to the Atlantic, inflicting a major logistical and psychological blow to the Confederacy. After reaching the ocean, Sherman invaded the Carolinas. Operations in the Western Theater concluded with the surrender of Southern forces to the Union armies in North Carolina and Florida in May 1865 following General Robert E. Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House.\n",

Milwaukee businessman Bud Selig stepped in, and relocated the team to Wisconsin and renamed it the Milwaukee Brewers a week before the start of the 1970 season. As a result of this move, the city, King County, and the state of Washington sued the American League, claiming a breach of contract. The league agreed to grant Seattle another franchise in exchange for dropping the lawsuit. It was under Uhlman's watch that the Kingdome was constructed and opened (in 1976), and Seattle was given another MLB team in the form of the Mariners (who began play in 1977), and an NFL team called the Seahawks (who began play in 1976).\n",

Some persons might claim that the world of 'THX 1138' is here right now. A more reasonable opinion would hold that we are facing the problems of that world right now. Time has passed the film by.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \"It is not, however, as either chase drama, or social drama, that 'THX 1138' is most interesting. Rather it's as a stunning montage of light, color and sound effects that create their own emotional impact ... Lucas's achievement in his first feature is all the more extraordinary when you realize that he is 25 years old, and that he shot most of the film in San Francisco, on a budget that probably would not cover the cost of half of one of the space ships in Stanley Kubrick's '2001.'\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety observed, \"Likely not to be an artistic or commercial success in its own time, the American Zoetrope (Francis Ford Coppola group) production just might in time become a classic of stylistic, abstract cinema.\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times praised the film as \"a stunning deployment of the aural and visual resources of the screen to suggest a fearful new world of tyranny by technology,\" adding that \"Lucas is obviously a master of cinematic effects with a special remarkable gift for discovering the look of the future in mundane places like parking structures and office corridors.\" Champlin stressed that the \"real excitement of 'THX 1138' is not really the message but the medium\u2014the use of film not to tell a story so much as to convey an experience, a credible impression of a fantastic and scary dictatorship of tomorrow.\" Kenneth Turan wrote in The Washington Post, \"Fortunately, the film comes over not at all trite but rather as enormously affecting. Lucas obviously believed strongly in this futuristic vision, and the film draws its vitality and unity from his belief, and from the fact that it was not bottled up to meet arbitrary conditions but allowed the free rein necessary to reach completeness.\" Penelope Houston of The Monthly Film Bulletin commented, \"Details of the future society\u2014control panels, monitor screens, soothing TV commercial voices, unshakeably calm robot policemen, the human animal turned automaton in appearance and function, but breaking out into a doomed love affair\u2014are all tolerably persuasive, but in sum total rather a pile-up of predictability. On the Orwellian level of ideas, Lucas' passive new world is too indeterminate to carry enough conviction and, consequently, enough of a menacing charge.\"\n",

It feeds into Mansfield Hollow reservoir at its end, making it a tributary to the Mount Hope, Natchaug, and Willimantic rivers. The Fenton River is fed by several smaller brooks, streams, and creeks. It is used as a water source by the University of Connecticut Storrs Campus, and is as thus relatively shallow. The stone Gristmill on the intersection of Stonemill and Gurleyville roads was once functional, and now is protected by the Joshua's Tract Conservation and Historic Trust. Along its shores are huge swaths of protected land, mainly belonging to the university, Joshua's Trust, Nipmuck Trail, or other such preserve. Soil erosion is a small problem along some stretches. The USGS has a river flow and height monitoring station posted in the Fenton on Old Turnpike Road, in Storrs. It is currently not being pumped due to drought.\n",

Sometime after journeying around the Willamette Valley and Columbia Basin, Moore bought title to approx. on the west side of Willamette Falls, across the Willamette River from Oregon City, from a local Native American chief, on which he platted a town he called \"Robin's Nest\" in early 1843. He also filed a provisional claim with the then government of the Oregon Country, not knowing if his transaction would be honored by the eventual governing laws. The Oregon Territorial Legislature voted to rename it Linn City on December 22, 1845 as a memorial to Senator Lewis F. Linn after whom Linn County is also named. Linn was a neighbor and family friend of the Moores from their time as settlers in the early Missouri Territory.\n",

Redistricting of congressional seats is traditionally done following the decennial U.S. census; the 2003 plan, which had been engineered by U.S. Representative Tom DeLay (R-Texas), would have been an unprecedented second redistricting in the same decade, and was promoted as a way to increase Republican electoral success. By leaving the state to stay in an Oklahoma hotel, Democrats temporarily delayed passage of the redistricting plan the Republican-controlled House. Republicans eventually succeeded at the re-redistricting, although in 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that new borders of the 25th Congressional District, a long thin chain of counties from Austin to Mexico, dubbed the \"Fajita Strip\", was in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, since it divided up predominantly Hispanic areas into multiple districts, and a U.S. district judge ordered new boundaries favorable to incumbent Democrats Ciro Rodriguez and Lloyd Doggett to be drawn.\n",

According to the 1871 census they were living at 1, George Place in Gourock with their four children: Mary, William, Agnes and Archibald. The 1881 census reveals that by then the family were living in Glasgow where William Somerville Shanks was working as a pattern designer for a curtain manufacturer. However, William Shanks had ambitions to be an artist, and after attended evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art under Francis Henry Newbery he made painting his career, in 1889 travelling to Paris to improve his skills, studying for three years at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian under Jean-Paul Laurens and Benjamin Constant. In Paris Shanks became influenced by the paintings of Edouard Manet. His painting Tiddley Winks was exhibited at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in 1897 and at one time was owned by Eliot Hodgkin who sold it to art dealer Charlotte Frank, the aunt of Anne Frank; Sir David Montagu Douglas Scott obtained it from her in 1962 for \u00a360. On loan to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge from 2007 to 2008, it sold at Sotheby's in 2008 for \u00a3181,250, a record for the artist. Shanks was to become a regular exhibitor at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and the Royal Scottish Academy.\n",

Ian Wade of BBC Online wrote that the song \"channels the avenging rock'n'roll soul of Wanda Jackson.\" Tom Townshend of MSN Music found a \"similar primal stomp\" to \"Rolling in the Deep\" (2010) which made a \"pacey, hypnotic, funk, interrupted by sublime symphonic blues.\" According to the sheet music published by Universal Music Publishing Group at the website Musicnotes.com, \"Rumour Has It\" is written in the key of D minor. It is set in a time signature of common time with an up-tempo beat of 126 beats per minute. Adele's vocal ranges from the note of D to the note of B4.\n",

After Statler and Waldorf's review of the performance, Kristen Bell asks for Gaga's autograph. This annoys Miss Piggy who was planning her own finale and enlists the Muppets to hold auditions. Gaga performs \"Applause\", followed by \"Bennie and the Jets\" and \"Artpop\" with Elton John (with the Muppets joining them for the latter). After discussing ideas for the finale, Gaga performs \"Manicure\" and the Muppets talk about the most inappropriate gifts they ever received. Kermit the Frog joins Gaga in a duet of \"Gypsy\", and Joseph Gordon-Levitt duets on \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\". Kermit's friendship with Gaga angers Miss Piggy; after a performance of \"Fashion!\" by Gaga and RuPaul, Miss Piggy bemoans the attention paid to the singer. Although she dreams of singing \"Santa Baby\", she is upstaged in her dream by Youthful Praise. After a trailer for the upcoming Muppets Most Wanted, Gaga asks Miss Piggy to suggest a finale and reprises \"Applause\" with the Muppets.\n",

    "text": "William Bartram was a Quaker and the son of naturalist John Bartram. In 1772, Dr. John Fothergill of London commissioned William Bartram to explore the Florida territories, collecting seeds, making drawings, and taking specimens of unfamiliar plants. Bartram sailed from Philadelphia in March 1773, explored Georgia, and began exploring East Florida in March 1774, especially the St. Johns River and the Alachua Savanna peopled by Seminole Indians. Returning to Charleston, Bartram set out for the southern Appalachians and the Cherokee country in April 1775, unaware that war had broken out in New England. Bartram crossed the Chattahoochee River into what later became the state of Alabama, then traveled to Mobile and Pensacola. Despite illness, he continued his journey west along the Gulf coast and up the Mississippi River beyond Baton Rouge. Sailing again to Mobile, he traveled inland late in the year to the Creek Indian settlements on the Tallapoosa River. In January 1776 Bartram returned to Georgia, shipped the last of his plant specimens to London from Savannah, and returned home to Philadelphia. The sequence of his journey is not reproduced exactly in Bartram's Travels.\n",

After recording just 18 rushing yards against the Philadelphia Eagles in the season opener on Monday Night Football and 25 rushing yards against the New York Giants, Freeman received his first career start on September 27, 2015 against the Dallas Cowboys. Against the Cowboys, Freeman had a breakout performance by rushing for a then career-high 141 yards and three touchdowns on 30 carries. The next week, he rushed for three touchdowns again to go along with 68 rushing yards against the Houston Texans. In the following game against the Washington Redskins, he rushed for a career-high 153 yards to start a three-game streak of 100 yard performances from Weeks 4-7. In Week 11 against the Indianapolis Colts, Freeman recorded 43 yards off three carries before leaving in the first half with a concussion. By the end of the season, Freeman totaled 1,634 yards-from-scrimmage (5th in the NFL), 14 all-purpose touchdowns (1st) with 1,056 rushing yards (7th) and 11 rushing touchdowns (1st). He also finished the 2015 season ranked third among NFL running backs in both receptions (73) and receiving yards (578) along with three receiving touchdowns. Following the season, Freeman was selected to the Pro Bowl, the first of his career, and was named a Second-team All-Pro. Freeman was named one of the captains, along with Geno Atkins of the Cincinnati Bengals, for Team Irvin in the 2016 Pro Bowl. He was ranked as the 50th best player in the NFL and the fifth best running back by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.\n",

The 13th Parachute Battalion saw combat during Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in the early hours of 6 June 1944, D-Day. The battalion served as normal infantrymen for the duration of the Battle of Normandy until being withdrawn, with the rest of the division, to England in September 1944. The 6th Airborne Division was then sent to Belgium in December 1944 to fight in the Ardennes offensive, the Battle of the Bulge.

In 1994, rather than seeking a fourth term in the Senate, Bedsole, considered a Moderate Republican, ran for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.

James, considered a conservative, defeated Bedsole, 130,233 (62.4 percent) to 79,338 (37.6 percent). Eliminated the first round of balloting was Winton Blount III, son of the former Postmaster General of the United States Winton M. Blount Jr., the Republican U.S. Senate nominee in 1972 against John Sparkman. Bedsole refused to endorse James in the general election, but he narrowly prevailed over the Democratic Governor James Folsom Jr., who had succeeded to the governorship after the forced exodus of Republican Governor H. Guy Hunt of Cullman. Oddly, James as the Democratic nominee in 1978 had handily defeated Guy Hunt, as Bedsole was elected to the state House of Representatives.\n",

This led to an interest in asphalt for paving city streets, after a government study determined it to be the best available method. He incorporated Barber Asphalt Paving Co. in 1883 to produce asphalt, and in 1887, secured a 42-year monopoly concession from the British Government for the Pitch Lake in Trinidad, the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world. He was also managing director of Trinidad Lake Asphalt Co., Limited, incorporated in London in 1898. Barber moved the Washington-based business to New York City, and it continued to expand, becoming, against Barber's wishes, part of an asphalt trust. By 1900, he had laid over 12 million square yards of Trinidad asphalt pavement in 70 American cities at a cost of $35 million. Barber retired from the business in 1901, just before the trust collapsed, but returned to the industry in 1904.\n",

He was named second-team All-American by the United Press in 1937. In a November 14, 1936, game against Minnesota, he set a then-school record with a 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, quick kicked 90 yards, and had an onside kick that traveled 50 yards into Minnesota's end zone and was recovered by a Longhorn teammate for a touchdown. Wolfe kicked a game-winning field goal in a 9-6 win against Baylor on November 6, 1937. The victory knocked Baylor out of Rose Bowl contention. He turned down an invitation to compete in the decathlon at the 1936 Olympics.\n",

He was loaned to Hellas Verona in 1989, but was one of the two Roma players (the other being Andrea Carnevale) to be suspended for a year in October 1990 after failing a doping test because of an appetite suppressant he was taking at the time, which contained the banned substance Phentermine. His signing with Juventus in 1991 successfully revived his career and he soon surpassed Stefano Tacconi as the club's starting goalkeeper, remaining with the team until 1999, and winning the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year Award in 1997 and 1998, as well as the Guerin d'oro in 1997. Peruzzi won three Serie A titles, a Coppa Italia, two Supercoppa Italiana titles, a UEFA Cup, a UEFA Super Cup, an Intercontinental Cup and was part of Juventus' 1996 UEFA Champions League title squad that defeated Ajax in the final on penalties, saving two in the final shoot-out. He also reached two more consecutive Champions League finals with the Turin-based club, as well as a semi-final finish during his final season with the club. Peruzzi also won a runners-up medal in the 1995 UEFA Cup final and in the 1992 Coppa Italia final, and was voted to the ESM Team of the Year during the 1996\u201397 and the 1997\u201398 seasons. Over this period, several pundits began to consider him one of the most reliable goalkeepers in the world, if not the best one, due to his consistency, with Maurizio Crosetti describing him as \"the best goalkeeper in the world\" in 1997.\n",

He made his first team debut in the 1953\u201354 season under the management of Frank Taylor after turning professional at the age of 17. He played a further three Second Division games in 1955\u201356, before making nine appearances in 1956\u201357, and then breaking into the first team with 28 appearances in 1957\u201358. He scored his first senior goal on 9 September 1957, in a 5\u20133 home defeat to Bristol Rovers. He made 44 appearances in the 1958\u201359 campaign, scoring six goals, including one in a 4\u20133 win over Liverpool at Anfield. During the campaign he played at five different positions: right-back, right-half, centre-half, inside-right and inside-left. He played 38 times in 1959\u201360, before new manager Tony Waddington began to play him in an attacking role in 1960\u201361. During the campaign he scored seven goals in 40 games, scoring twice in a 9\u20130 thrashing of Plymouth Argyle, and hitting a hat-trick past Charlton Athletic in a 5\u20133 home win on 16 January 1961. He made 47 appearances in 1961\u201362, scoring four goals.\n",

U.S. and Cuban troops placed some 55,000 land mines across the no man's land, creating the second-largest minefield in the world, and the largest in the Americas. On 16 May 1996, Bill Clinton, the President of the United States, ordered their removal. The U.S. land mines have since been replaced with motion and sound sensors to detect intruders.

She started with CUSO in 1966, at a girls' camp in Northern Province, Zambia, near Lake Tanganyika before relocating to Lusaka. She worked with an Indian official to evaluate a UNESCO-sponsored literacy program. She later worked in community development. Smallface met her South African husband, Jacob Marule, while living in Zambia. He was a refugee of apartheid and an exiled member of the African National Congress and was immersed in the Non-Aligned Movement prominent in Lusaka when Marule met him. Marule traveled to Tanzania and was influenced by Julius Nyerere's philosophy on African socialism. She was intrigued by his respect for culture, and tradition while also exploring decolonization. Marule later influenced George Manuel, the first president of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples, with her ideas on using indigenous philosophy to guide politics. A moped accident left her in a hospital in Lusaka for six to eight weeks. In the fall of 1970, Marule and her husband Jacob moved to Ottawa. There they hosted social and political gatherings, which included politicians as well as Manuel and diplomats from a number of African countries. Jacob Marule worked at an agricultural centre in Kentville, Nova Scotia. Subsequently, they had two daughters and a grand-niece who they raised as their own child. \n",

Upon his accession he wrote to Peter the Venerable and the monks of Cluny, asking them to pray for him, while he was congratulated by Arnulf of Lisieux. Regardless of the brevity of his reign, he was prepared to chart a very different course from that of his predecessor. He was opposed to Innocent II's concessions to King Roger II of Sicily and refused to ratify the Treaty of Mignano (\"a foolish policy, which he survived - just - long enough to regret\"). He was in favor of the House of Plantagenet\u2019s claim to the English throne, thus opposed to King Stephen of England. To emphasise this shift, he refused to renew the legatine authority that Innocent II had granted to King Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois. Celestine also favored the Templars, ordering a general collection for them, as well as the Hospitallers, giving them control of the hospital of Saint Mary Teutonicorum in Jerusalem.\n",

However, the inspection team from the Department of Agriculture (led by Flora Wambaugh Patterson) found that the trees were infested with insects and nematodes, concluding that the trees had to be destroyed to protect local growers. President Taft gave the order to burn the trees on January 28. Secretary of State Philander C. Knox wrote a letter expressing the regret of all involved to the Japanese Ambassador. Takamine responded to the news with another donation for more trees, 3020 in all, of a lineage taken from a famous group of trees along the Arakawa River in Tokyo and grafted onto stock from Itami, Hyogo Prefecture. On February 14, 1912, 3020 cherry trees of twelve cultivars were shipped on board the Awa Maru and arrived in D.C. via rail car from Seattle on March 26.\n",
